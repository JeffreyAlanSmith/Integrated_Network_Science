  # add it to its transpose, yielding a matrix of 0s, 1s 
  # and 2s. If it is null, the resulting value will be 0 
  # (neither ij nor ji exists); if it is asymmetric there
  # will be a 1 (as ij or ji exists but not both); and 
  # if it is mutual there will be a 2 (as there are ties 
  # from ij and ji).
