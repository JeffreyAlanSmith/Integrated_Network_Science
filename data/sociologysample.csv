39628,"Ontogenic variables, such as the experience of the parent's abuse as a child and current_depression or substance abuse, were expected_to_have_a_greater_impact on the risk of child_abuse than microsystem and exosystem_variables such as family functioning, domestic violence, income, community safety, and social support. It was expected that social_support would have the greatest_impact of these broader system variables. It is believed that attachment_style_mediates the relationship between the ontogenic system level and microsystem/exosystem level variables. Secondary data were used to examine these systemic impacts. The dataset was obtained from the National_Data_Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect. The sample_consisted of 265 women, the majority of whom were African-American and who had a high_school_education or GED. The majority of these women were employed, while others were in school or a training_program at the time of the interview. Over 50 percent_of_the_sample had never been married. A multiple_regression_analysis_was_conducted_to_examine_the_impact of factors from three systems levels on the risk of child abuse. Variables were entered into the multiple_regression equation after they had demonstrated significance in bi-variate analyses with Bonferroni corrections. Mother's age was entered first in this equation in order to control for any potential effect of this variable as it has been shown_to_be_significantly_related_to_risk of abuse. Entered in the second step were the ontogenic variables found to be significant: depression and locus of control. In the third and final step, the microsystem and exosystem_variables found_to_have_a_significant_impact on the risk of abuse were entered: the number of social supports available to the mother, the mother's assessment_of_family_functioning and the frequency of domestic_violence perpetrated against her. Locus of control and mother's depression were demonstrated to be the most important predictors in the equation. Domestic violence_and_social_support were the next most important predictors, with family_functioning becoming non-significant in this equation. This supports the hypothesis that ontogenic variables have the greater_impact in predicting risk of physical abuse. A path_analysis_was_conducted_in_order_to_examine the possible time order and causal_nature of these variables. All variables were included in this analysis. The only variables found to impact the risk of physical_abuse were depression and locus of control. The only route from experiencing childhood_sexual_abuse to the risk of committing child_physical_abuse was through the level of depression currently being experienced by the mother. Mother's locus_of_control impacted the risk of abuse directly as well as through its impact on depression. Risk of abuse was not influenced directly by the experience_of_sexual abuse."
39745,"This study_analyzes attitudes of area residents toward mineral_extraction and processing in the Northern Great_Plains_region of the U.S. Three major_dimensions of people's attitudes toward energy development are examined: (1) belief in economic_opportunities_provided by development; (2) political effects of mineral development; and (3) concern about protecting the environment. Previous empirical studies of attitudes toward the economic opportunity afforded by industrial_development suggest that there is little or no significant difference in belief in economic opportunity between people who have experienced development and those who have not had such experience. Previous studies, however, have paid_little_attention_to_the_effect type of development might have on attitudes toward economic opportunity. It is, therefore, postulated in this study that type of development also has little effect on belief in economic opportunity. The literature reviewed suggests that attitudes_toward_political_change are not strongly_affected by experience with development. A dominant theme_underlying the expectations about attitudes_toward_political changes accompanying development is the distrust of outsiders by inhabitants of the region. Kraenzel (1955) and Toole (1976) describe numerous_ways in which development of the Great_Plains has been dominated by the eastern establishment, often to the detriment of inhabitants of the region. Since energy development is one more example of development which is controlled_primarily from cities outside of the region, it is to be expected that the political changes accompanying energy development will be like changes experienced by inhabitants_of_the_region with earlier developments. Such changes are unlikely to be perceived as desirable by local people. The theoretical_rationale for expectations of attitudes toward the environment is based substantially on research by Vogt (1955) and Kluckhohn_and_Strodtbeck (1961) which stresses the view that western people_perceive the natural_environment as something to be mastered. It is concluded from these studies that inhabitants of the Plains would favor development_of_natural_resources even if such development resulted in environmental degradation. Surveys from six counties in the region permit an examination of the relationship of these attitudes to the level of development occurring and to political_and_economic_interests in an effort_to_understand better the process_of_social change. A primary_focus of the analysis is the effect which length of experience with development and different types of development have on attitudes. The analysis also focuses on differences among the major economic_interest_groups in rural_communities where mineral development is taking place. Data for the analysis come from studies carried out by researchers at the University_of_Wyoming from 1973 to 1976. The survey instruments were part of social_impact_assessment_studies funded by Atlantic Richfield Company, the Missouri Basin Power Project, and the Old West Regional Commission."
49780,"This dissertation is an experiment in thinking with the story, not about the story in order to erase_the_boundaries between analysis and narrative. CASA, Community Action Stops Abuse, is the context for this research on the lived realities and meaning of working with an empowerment philosophy. A University-Community Initiative (UCI) grant with CASA and the University_of_South_Florida is the occasion to study the communicative_aspects of individual_and_collective perceptions of empowerment. The dissertation_focuses broadly on two UCI project goals: developing a collaborative relationship and producing a booklet of stories about the work of paid_staff and volunteers. The heart_of_the_dissertation is my relationship with the CASA workers and how scholarship and advocacy intersect with a philosophy of reciprocal and compassionate empowerment. This layered account of my CASA experiences is framed by my observations at the National_Coalition_Against_Domestic Violence conference. The narrative methodology supports a feminist_philosophy that extends the personal and the political to the personal as the theoretical. The CASA workers and I engage in what Kenneth Gergen calls poetic activism, writing or speaking about something in order to cause change, a form_of_communication activism. My dissertation is based on feminist_research principles in the form of engaged_scholarship and participatory_action_research accomplished through participant_observation and interactive interviews, written as ethnographic narratives, life stories, and autoethnographic stories. I coined_the_term research novel because my research data is reported in a creative, narrative_format that integrates the literature review, methodology, and analysis throughout the story. The boundary between analysis and narrative is dissolved with an emphasis on connected knowing, the language of possibilities, appreciative inquiry, strengths-based service, and positive refraining. Rather than oppositional approaches of either/or thinking, my work embraces the ambiguities, contradictions, multiple_identities and blurred boundaries of our lived experiences. The concept_of_empowerment can be ambiguous, particularly for women who are seeking ways_to_redefine_power and empowerment. An area for further study is the connection between empowerment and the framing of vulnerability, including individuals' perceptions of the paradoxical_nature of compassion for self and others."
18794,"The concepts of parent_empowerment and participation, currently popular in the disability field, that emerge from the American_ideals of equity and choice lose much of their meaning when transplanted within India, where the rigidly_hierarchical culture precludes the rights of low_income_parents with disabled children. This study of the perspectives of low-income Indian_families found both professionals_and_parents culturally conditioned into their roles. The middle-class professionals defined parent_participation in terms of parent_education and provided no forum for the parents' input when making decisions about their child's education; in turn, the parents, always aware of their low_socioeconomic status, did not demand the opportunity to be allowed to participate. The study suggests, one, that arguments_based on the Indian values of social duties and obligations, rather than parental rights, will be more conducive to convincing professionals that parents be given a voice, and, two, that, in time, the deliberate and conscious inclusion of parents by professionals in the decision-making process will lead to a more equitable_distribution_of_power in parent-professional interactions."
17548,"No nationally administered program has come under more fire than our social_welfare system. ""Welfare"" is now a code word for a national bureaucratic program that is destroying local_community_organizations and encouraging long_term dependency primarily among poor, inner city minority citizens. But criticisms of the welfare_state obscure its true size_and_scope as well as misrepresent its program objectives and outcomes. In addition, such criticisms do not correspond with the actual configuration of the American_welfare_state since services are organized and implemented_at_the_local_level by community and faith-based organizations. Local governments retain jurisdiction over the planning_process as it affects service location, and despite the emergence of the welfare state, its programs_continue to be characterized by four key elements. These include (1) the third party_organizational structure; (2) the decentralized and separate jurisdictions of federal_and_local governments; (3) the fundamental_role of the local_planning process; and (4) the class_and_racial_segregation characterizing American cities. These factors raise an important question: If local_forces continue to regulate the organization of services, what has changed since the emergence of the welfare state? This dissertation_attempts_to_answer_this_question_by_examining the third party organization_of_the_welfare_state and the local_political and geographical constraints placed upon community_organizations that deliver its services. I investigate the functions at the local_level of one particular segment of the welfare state: community and faith-based relief services and shelters provided to homeless people. Using New York_City as my study area, I conduct analyses for time periods before (1920s) and after (1990s) the emergence of the welfare state. Key findings indicate that despite the emergence of the welfare state, community and faith-based organizations continue_to_provide_services while local governments continue to retain jurisdiction over the planning process. The most prominent faith-based organizations_providing_services are those that have broad religious affiliations such as the Y.M.C.A., Catholic_Charities and the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. These organizations continue to deliver_services as they did prior to the emergence of the welfare state. However, today the federal_government has a more significant_role in funding distribution--even for these faith-based organizations. Second, the socioeconomic_characteristics_of_neighborhoods where welfare_services locate are very similar to that of the 1920s. In addition, during both time periods, the concentrated presence of welfare_services does not negate the presence of more mainstream_community institutions, particularly churches, schools and libraries."
6848,"After forty years' compulsory Guoyu policy, the Taiwanese may be experiencing a language_shift from Minnanyu (mother tongue of their ethnic group) to Guoyu (the national language). Meanwhile, the dramatic socio-economic and political improvements by the Taiwanese in the past_ten_years have enabled them to compete with the Mainlanders and thus they have a stronger claim to have the right to promote the status of their language and maintain it. This study_was_designed_and_conducted_in_order_to_investigate whether or not the Taiwanese are experiencing language_shift or language maintenance, with a focus on analyzing its social_and_political determinants. In this study, both survey_and_interview techniques were used for quantitative_and_qualitative measurements of this linguistic phenomenon. From the results of the questionnaires and the face-to-face interviews, evidence of language_shift and the distributions of the two languages were discovered. First, proficiency in Guoyu by the Taiwanese is increasing, while that in Minnanyu is decreasing. Second, Guoyu is used in all domains, even for home communication and religious purpose. Moreover, choices between Guoyu and Minnanyu seem not to have been substantially affected by attitudes toward the two ethnic_groups and the two languages, or by objection to the language policy. More importantly, younger Taiwanese do not demand a one-to-one relationship between Taiwanese ethnic_identity and Minnanyu, and they tend to keep dual Taiwanese_and_Chinese identities, or even replace their ethnic_identity with a national identity. Lastly, to different extents, age, educational level, gender, and region_of_origin are found_to_be_related to language_choice by the Taiwanese. It is predicted that this language_shift will continue, although at a slow rate, and that Minnanyu will temporarily survive on the oral level as a medium serving limited functions, mainly to satisfy partial needs for domestic business exchange, for cross-generational communication with the old (especially those over 60 years old) in the Taiwanese families, and for religion. Eventually, the transformation of the Taiwanese_attitudes towards their own ethnic_identity and their heavy_dependence on Guoyu will bring about the functional demise of Minnanyu."
34226,"This study examines the genealogy of Wordsworth's conception of a ""spiritual community binding together the living and the dead."" His early_poems_explore the limits and foundations of this ""community,"" often envisioning its structure as triadic, articulated between mourners and the dead. One can schematize and temporalize this ""binding"" as involving first a loss that, when subsequently expressed in memorializing acts, leads to mournful bonds of connection. It is this socially_constitutive_relationship between these dead and living that each of the three chapters of my thesis_considers in close readings of Wordsworth's poetry. The first chapter_examines_the_ways in which the dead in The Vale of Esthwaite (1787) and An Evening Walk (1793-94) underlie quests for social-domestic connection. In the former poem a lack of mourning is the basis for tributes to grief paid as underworld descents. These katabases in turn lead to topographies in which, as in An Evening Walk, lie promissory traces of a bond between the dead and living. The Salisbury_Plain poems (1793-96), the subject of Chapter Two, similarly employ a quest-like structure to transgress alienating social and other limitations. Amid a desolate landscape at the outskirts of society, ghostly rituals emblematize a desired messianic power in narrative to bind and unbind the living and dead so as to institute an assembly of mourners and mourned. Community is here the dead speaking or spoken, a dialectic of ghostly crossings at the social-semantic margins of life and death. Chapter Three analyzes the The Ruined_Cottage (1797), an intertextual_work in which community is also connected to a revisitation of some hidden grief, with mournful tales leading to sources of otherness and loss owed to breaches of connection. In these memorial, allegorical meetings of alienated others Wordsworth thus locates a power to bind the living in relation to the dead. Hence, during a decade of upheaval and death, Wordsworth's early_poems envision the ""binding"" power of the dead as a basis for constituting and conserving English community at its own topographical and mortal margins."
12683,"The dissertation_examines_the_intersection_of_art_and_politics in the work of Finland's national painter, Axel Gall&eacute;n (1865-1931) (after 1907, Akseli Gall&eacute;n-Kallela) during the pre-independence period that witnessed Finland's evolution from a buffer_zone of the Russian empire into a self-conscious and determined modern nation. In contrast_to_earlier_investigations of Gall&eacute;n's art, the study_focuses upon the inner mechanisms of regional nationalism (the politicization of an indigenous people's history and cultural heritage) as witnessed in the artist's appropriation of Finnish oral traditions and fading regional customs. Examined in detail are Gall&eacute;n's relations to his patrons, French_and_German artistic circles, Finnish rural_inhabitants of different social classes, and his colleagues in the nationalist Young Finland circle. The dichotomy between Finno-Swedish and Finno-Finnish culture as evinced in Gall&eacute;n's art is considered as a civil_conflict spawned by severe economic, social, and political inequities between different segments of the Finnish_population historically. Also, the schism between city and country, mirrored in the clash between literate_and_oral cultures, is explored as a polarity that shaped Gall&eacute;n's constructed image of modern Finland. A secondary_objective of the dissertation is to re-evaluate misunderstood aspects of Gall&eacute;n's career (his relation to European Naturalism and Symbolism, for example) and to introduce new documentary and visual material. The rediscovery of Gall&eacute;n's 1880s masterpiece, Peasant Life (1887), which was thought destroyed in World_War I, opens a new path for understanding the amalgamation of real_and_fictive elements in Gall&eacute;n's naturalist works. Examining the significance of biblical_motifs in the artist's 1890s works, neglected in earlier scholarship, illuminates_the_intersection of international and regional myths in late nineteenth-century Finnish art. Finally, an analysis of Gall&eacute;n's mythological works inspired by Finland's national epic, the Kalevala, demonstrates how the artist refuted the autonomy of written_language and assumed the mantel of a painter-creator within a shifting socio-political context. Although thematically and geopolitically anchored to Finnish terrain, the dissertation_seeks_to_make_a_significant_contribution to broader re-examinations of European nationalist movements and to investigations of art_inspired by oral cultural traditions."
1170,"Prime Time Activism locates itself in two literatures, social_movement theory, particularly the literature_on_political discourse, and secondly, sociological_literature_addressing the mass media. Building on two case studies, one of a union, another of an anti-intervention organization, Prime Time Activism treats news as an arena in which social movements battle establishment institutional interests. Ryan begins_with_a_critique of three theoretical models in media sociology: gatekeeper studies like Herbert Gans; cultural studies like Todd Gitlin; and structuralist studies like Noam Chomsky. She proceeds to argue for a constructionist_model which draws from each of the three traditions but also grounds itself in a notion_of_political discourse. Through the case studies, Ryan pursues two themes; how social movements frame messages, and how movements address problems gaining access_to_mainstream_media institutions. Ryan argues that in framing their messages, social movements must address a range of tasks: diagnostic (what is the issue), prognostic (what is the movement strategy, its understanding of targets and allies), and motivational (why act). Therefore, using the mass_media_to_convey a movement message requires_integration of media strategy with broader_political strategy. In relation to access, she argues that social movements need to develop_a_deep_understanding of mainstream_media institutions and the cultural/structural constraints within which media_professionals operate. In a final chapter, she summarizes the successes achieved in each case study, the costs incurred, and draws some general conclusions."

38056,"Parent involvement (PI) in education is associated with positive_outcomes for students, and improving parent_involvement is often advocated_as_a_means for schools to increase student achievement. Little is known about how parents_decide to be involved in their child's education; however, a few models have recently been proposed that hypothesize what variables are most influential in parents' involvement decisions. This study_examined four variables (parents' role construction, sense of efficacy, resources, and specific invitations for involvement) and their relationship to three types of PI (i.e., parent_involvement at school-events, parent_involvement at school-ongoing activities, and parent_involvement at home). Two hypotheses were tested. First, parents' role construction and sense_of_efficacy were hypothesized_to_be_differentially_related to their involvement behaviors. Second, parents' resources and specific teacher invitations were hypothesized to operate as mediators between parents' beliefs (i.e., role construction and sense of efficacy) and their involvement behaviors. English- and Spanish-speaking parents_of_elementary_students from a large, urban_district were surveyed and results_were_analyzed using path analysis. Results indicated that parents' role_beliefs and specific invitations from teachers had significant_direct_effect on parents' involvement behaviors, with specific invitations having the largest effect. Parents' sense_of_efficacy and resources had limited effects, and limited_support_for_the_mediational_hypothesis was found.

30072,"The purpose_of_this_investigation_was_to_examine parents' perceptions concerning their involvement in school-based science_learning_programs for families. Parents representing_twelve families who had attended Family Science learning_programs at one central_Texas_elementary_school during the 1997-98 school_year acted as participant informants for this qualitative study. Family Science programs were held during the evening_hours in the school_cafeteria and were designed to engage the participants in active, investigatory science activities. Four research_questions_guided_the_inquiry process: (a) What were parents' expectations of the program? (b) What were parents' perceptions concerning the benefits_for_children_and_parents who participated in Family Science learning programs? (c) What were parents' perceptions concerning their role(s) in Family Science cooperative_learning activities? and (d) What school_practices or conditions supported or enhanced parents' positive involvement decisions? Formal and informal_interviews with participants, direct observation, and review_of_program_documents were sources_of_data_for_this_qualitative study. Findings indicate that the parents who participated had constructed a considerable understanding of their own children's preferred_learning styles/strategies prior_to_attending the program, and that these understandings facilitated the parents' cognitive scaffolding of their children as they explored science concepts. Additionally, the majority of parents reported that their participation in Family Science learning_programs fostered positive_attitudes in their children toward science and/or school as well as providing_opportunities_for_parents to learn more about their children's interests and abilities. Parents also reported that they learned about the school's science_program and how to involve their children in science_learning_activities outside of school. School-based science_learning_programs for families represent ""promising practice"" for promoting parental involvement in science_education by enhancing awareness of exemplary_science_education practices, connecting home and school experiences, and promoting positive_attitudes toward science. Overall, the study suggests that those who wish to increase parental_support for and involvement in children's science_education must focus at least partially on the parent's perspective."
11604,"Identifying human_society and the natural_environment as separate systems is the most fundamental_challenge facing wildlife conservation. Human society cannot conserve wildlife without understanding the relationship between natural and social processes, and then applying that understanding in the policy arena. This dissertation_focuses on assessing the role of households as a nexus in coupled human and natural systems (CHANS). Under this goal I address 4 objectives: (1) evaluate_the_relationship between global wildlife endangerment and household density in biodiversity_hotspot nations, (2) explore how households mediate_the_relationship_between_social_and_natural_systems using the outdoor_recreation and environmental view relationship, (3) identify socio-demographic variables explaining variation in household_location_decisions with direct impacts on natural systems and wildlife_conservation and consider potential feedbacks in the model of environmental behavior, and (4) use a systems_modeling_approach_to_predict land_use_change in Teton Valley (Idaho and Wyoming) by integrating immigration, home construction, household_location decisions, and different policy scenarios. I use linear_multiple_regression models to demonstrate that household density provides a viable_alternative statistical_hypothesis to human_population_density for explaining species_endangerment at the global_level (household model, r 2 = 0.85; population model, r 2 = 0.84). I then suggest adopting a household perspective for biodiversity_conservation because social_norms_and_practices render a household approach_to_conservation more pragmatic than a human_population perspective. I addressed the final objectives using data_from_a_survey of Teton Valley residents. Results suggested environmentally oriented views relate positively to appreciative outdoor_recreation_participation and negatively to non-appreciative outdoor_recreation_participation for participants and their non-participating household members. Older and highly educated immigrants with the most environmentally oriented worldviews chose_to_live in natural areas (e.g., riparian zones, wetlands, critical winter_range for wildlife) in disproportionately_high numbers, and required significantly more homes per person than other groups. Length of residency was negatively_related to more environmentally oriented worldviews. Simulation results from the systems model suggest cluster development was the most important strategy for protecting open space. Growth slowing restrictions, or lack thereof, were the most important policies for regulating home construction. Finally composite rankings favored high_levels of cluster development and not implementing growth slowing restrictions or a vacation home ban. This simulation_model may also be a simple_and_intuitive tool for other regions where conservation_goals appear to clash with the economic well being of people. Aside from establishing the importance of household dynamics for wildlife conservation, this research_helps establish a new interdisciplinary_approach for CHANS research that focuses on homes as expressions of environmental views and behavior. The methods may be applied in many other areas where communities struggle to meet the needs of wildlife_and_humans in CHANS."
3482,"The sources of housing_satisfaction for formerly homeless_families were investigated in a group of 40 Black_and_Hispanic_women who had been rehoused through their stay in the New York_City_shelter system. Housing satisfaction was examined for this population because the constraints_imposed on housing_options for such families by the rehousing polices of New York City, and the macro-level social_and_economic_conditions shaped by their race, gender, and poverty, might hinder their opportunities for obtaining satisfaction with their housing. Respondents_were_interviewed_in_their_homes using a structured, open- and closed-ended interview which assessed a variety_of_potential housing_satisfaction factors such as pre-rehousing history, quality_and_satisfaction_ratings for the apartment, building, neighborhood and housing, perceived housing_alternatives and social connections. Housing satisfaction, as well as the other satisfaction and quality variables, was measured by a respondent's rating on a 5-point Likert scale. The research_investigated the following: (1) if the length_of_time rehoused was significantly_related to housing satisfaction; (2) if apartment quality, as compared to building_and_neighborhood quality, would have the highest_correlation with housing satisfaction; and (3) the primary reasons for the housing_satisfaction ratings. The quantitative_and_qualitative_data_analyses_revealed the following: (1) housing_tenure was not statistically related to housing satisfaction; (2) apartment quality, when compared to building_and_neighborhood quality, did not have the greatest_impact on housing satisfaction; and (3) analyses of the reasons for the housing_satisfaction rating revealed a meta-theme of qualifying the responses with a "" ... but ... "" clause which deflates the predominately positive ratings of the apartment and building quality_and_satisfaction scales. In addition, three dominant_themes_arose from the analyses of these responses: safety in the neighborhood; maintenance of the apartment and/or building; and interpersonal_relations with family, friends, neighbors and building staff. The implications_of_these_findings for policies concerning the rehousing of formerly homeless_families and low-income housing are discussed, in addition to concerns about the possible limitations of the construct of ""housing satisfaction"" for such populations."
16747,"This dissertation_is_an_ethnography of a culture practiced by the people of Riverfront in Central Wisconsin, based on my fieldwork from October 1984 to February 1987. ""Riverfront"" is a fictitious_name_for_a_real place. The central_problem in this dissertation is to understand how Riverfront people create, maintain, and recreate social_relationships with others. This problem is reflection of my concern about my own culture's ways. Japanese_people place a priority on relations that exist between persons, a practice called inter-personalism. It is my thesis that even such presumably individualistic societies as the United_States would have similar cultural operations as inter-personalism. Care, and sharing, are widely used terms in the United States; they are closest to my understanding of inter-personalism. Following ethnographic interest in the broader_range of everyday life, I explore how widely the meanings of caring and sharing are extended to different domains in Riverfront life. In addition to common ethnographic methods, I used the following method: I brought_back videotapes to a day-care center and a senior center where I had recorded them and showed them to people there. Then I showed them videotapes of my culture in which I had recorded similar situations. People talked about the social interactions they saw on the video screens as well as their ideas about social interaction. That is, their talk included their interpretations about caring and sharing as well as about social_interaction and social relationships, and I analyzed these interpretations. This dissertation first deals with how informants identify themselves and others in historical_and_geographical contexts. It proceeds to interpreting social interactions in various situations. Then it analyses the concepts and behaviors of caring and sharing and the meanings of family and community. Finally I discuss how my study_contributes to the idea of connectedness between individuals as countervailing the forces of separation which are inherent in the nature of individualism. The practices and meanings of caring and sharing described in this dissertation suggest that American concepts of human_connectedness exist in different forms and that it has been shaped differently from Japanese culture."
17100,"Modern medical_care is a collaborative activity among health_care_providers who work in complex, interconnected and dynamic organizations. To design effective_and_efficient work processes and organizations, health-care administrators must be able to understand and analyze the complex relationships among work processes, organizational structure, organizational participants, and the unexpected_events of medical care. Ideally, before subjecting their organizations to change, health-care administrators could simulate how well a proposed organization would perform in discharging a given set of protocols for its patient population. Simulation systems such as the Virtual_Design_Team (VDT) have been shown to make_accurate_predictions about the effectiveness and efficiency of alternative engineering project organizations. Unfortunately, these simulation tools, based on Galbraith's information-processing perspective, have models of work processes and organizations that are too rigid to represent and reason about the correspondingly more dynamic organizational structures, found in medical organizations. My work_extends the information-processing theory of organizations, described by Galbraith and encoded in ""emulation"" simulation systems such as VDT so that these simulation systems can be used to model the non-routine, ""diagnose and repair"" work processes and the flexible_organizational assignments that are required for delivering medical care. My research develops a theoretical_framework and simulation_system in which organizational questions about these more flexible organizations can be posed, tested in a simulation environment, and used to guide medical administrators charged with designing new organizations and protocols. I have extended Galbraith's notion of exceptions by creating four new exception types: activity addition, activity deletion, activity re-assignment, and activity substitution. These process exceptions can model activities in which agent-activity responsibilities are dynamic and activity exceptions alter_the_topology of the work process. I have tested these extensions to theory in an information-processing simulation_system_called OCCAM and modeled diagnostic_and_therapeutic exception-driven medical work processes. This research: (1) adds to current_understanding of how exceptions are modeled in the information-processing theory of organizations; (2) extends the range of organizations that can be modeled and simulated using an information-processing theory of organizations; and (3) provides useful tools to designers of medical organizations and work processes."

Forty_subjects had not been hospitalized for psychiatric_treatment since the divorce; forty subjects had been hospitalized for psychiatric treatment. Method. Coping style_was_assessed using the Kidcope; depression_was_assessed using the Reynolds_Adolescent_Depression_Scale (RADS); engagement in high-risk behaviors and suicidality were both determined by completion of the Youth_Risk_Behavior_Survey (YRBS). Sociodemographic data was collected. Results. A strong_association_was_found between a negative/avoidant coping_style and depression, truancy, and suicidality. Negative copers were 20 times as likely as positive/approach copers to be depressed, over three times as likely to have been truant, five times as likely to have had suicidal ideation, and over four times as likely to have made at least one suicide attempt since the divorce. Depression was significantly associated with the high-risk behaviors, and a strong_association_was_found_between_depression and suicidality. These relationships were most significant among the hospitalized adolescents, who were also more likely to have family_members who had attempted and/or committed suicide, and to have friends who had been hospitalized for treatment of depression. They were also more likely to report physical_abuse between their parents. Conclusions. This study reinforces the need for further research directed towards developing interventions which would facilitate adolescents' employment of adaptive_coping strategies."
17583,"Adolescent substance use remains_a_major_health_and_safety problem. A multitude of prevention_approaches has been employed to reduce_the_impact and incidence of substance use among youth. Considerable progress_has_been_made_over_the_past_thirty_years in identifying effective prevention approaches. The dilemma for administrators and policy_planners is to determine what types of adolescent_drug use prevention_programs to implement, given the contingent_nature of evidence regarding program effectiveness. While research on the distinctions between drug_prevention_programs is abundant, most of the prevention_programs have been developed_and_tested in school settings. Research has also been conducted with community settings, but there is comparatively little evidence on the consequences of intervention-differing attributes for community program outcomes. This study_analyzes community-based prevention research_findings from a variety of studies and integrates those results into a meta-analysis in order_to_identify_critical ingredients of effective programming. It focuses on two basic questions: (a) Does the evidence indicate that community-based intervention programs are capable of preventing, delaying, or reducing drug use by adolescents? If so, (b) is the variation in effectiveness related to the characteristics and settings of the intervention programs? Overall, the findings_provide_evidence_of_a_modest benefit of program participation for the average youth. The findings_show that 'comprehensive' and 'school-community' programs are more effective than 'community only' programs in influencing youth_drug use. These three community-based program categories are then compared to school-based program evaluations. The results_suggest that intervention characteristics, such as program focus and setting, influence program performance as measured_in_terms of drug use outcomes. The programs with a broader_focus delivered in multiple settings ('comprehensive' and 'school-community') appear to outperform narrower-focused programs delivered in a single setting ('community only' and 'school only') on major drug use outcomes."
43763,"Ecosystem management has evolved as a new approach to biodiversity conservation. Before implementing ecosystem management, organizations_and_agencies must first learn about and adopt the various elements of ecosystem management. This study looks at one group of organizations that is attempting_to_implement ecosystem management, Chicago Wilderness, and examines which factors promote adoption_of_ecosystem_management components. Components of ecosystem_management include collaboration, systems thinking, regional perspectives, adaptive management, and restoration_of_ecosystem processes. Chicago Wilderness is a group of more than 150 agencies_and_organizations working collaboratively to conserve biodiversity in the metropolitan_Chicago region. Through a mailed survey, data were collected from 299 respondents, representing 84% of the member organizations of Chicago Wilderness. Questions probed attitudes_and_beliefs about ecosystem_management as well as how the respondent and their organizations_participated in Chicago Wilderness activities. Information about individual_and_organizational traits was also collected. Results illustrate that participation_in_collaborative activities, even at a passive level, led_to_the_adoption of ecosystem management. As shown from regression modeling, passive involvement in Chicago Wilderness activities, in other words reading_materials and informally discussing issues, is a primary_predictor of adoption of ecosystem management, more so than other levels of involvement. Additionally, individual_and_organizational traits, including personal_feelings towards conservation, perceived_attitudes of the organizational leadership, and the organization's mission affect_the_extent to which ecosystem_management is adopted. The more personally responsible the respondent felt to find_solutions to conservation challenges the more likely he/she was to adopt the various components of ecosystem management. Perceptions of leadership_support (more than actual_leadership support) also determined the extent to which one participated in Chicago Wilderness and adopted ecosystem management. Exploratory in nature, this study spawns many questions for additional research, such as where does organizational_learning occur, as well as a number_of_recommendations for Chicago Wilderness and similar collaborative endeavors, such as allow time for informal networking. This study_begins to undercover some factors that may lead to organizational_learning and change, but as these are complex processes much more work_is_needed in this area."
12770,"Recent world_events make it clear that educators need to know how to help students get along and not judge one another based upon who they are. The study explored how interpersonal_contact experiences between White_students_and_Asian_American_students_at_the_University_of_Washington affected social tolerance, or forbearance towards those one does not like (Vogt, 1997), and cosmopolitanism, or appreciation and valuation of those who are different from oneself (Chickering and Reisser, 1993), in the White students. The study_examined how quantity of interpersonal_contact experiences, perceived favorableness of the contact experiences, that is, the degree to which the contact experiences were positively_perceived by the White students, and the source of initiation of contact, that is, whether the experiences were initiated by the White students, by the Asian_American students, or by dictate of the institution or other external source influenced social tolerance and cosmopolitanism in the White students. An original, self-administered questionnaire was created and mailed_to_a_random_sample of 1000 students_who_entered_the_University_of_Washington in the fall of 1999, which yielded a respondent sample of 319. Multiple_linear_regression_was_employed_to_identify_predictors of social tolerance versus cosmopolitanism. The two strongest_predictors_were_found to be quantity of interpersonal_contact experiences freshman year, with those who were cosmopolitan having had the most experiences, and sex, with women more likely to be cosmopolitan than men. Campus residency and perceived favorableness of interpersonal_contact experiences_freshman_year approached but did not quite attain significance at the p &lt; .05 level as positive predictors of cosmopolitanism. Quantity of interpersonal_contact experiences with Asian_American_students_in_high_school was found not be a significant predictor of social tolerance or cosmopolitanism. The results indicate that freshman_year is a critical_juncture for the development of behavioral_dispositions and attitudes towards others. Most students were either socially tolerant or cosmopolitan, but more students were socially tolerant than were cosmopolitan. Educators should design programs, therefore, which insure this baseline of civic behavior, but must also emphasize programs which promote understanding, acceptance, and valuation."
14982,"This study examines a model_based upon theoretically_derived_hypotheses_involving both objective_and_subjective variables as determinants of attitudes_toward_social change. In a time of uncertain_economic conditions, demographic shifts, technological_advances and diminishing federal funds, rural_communities are faced with many challenges. Thus, locally organized efforts, which are affected by the attitudes of the local people, take on increasing importance. An enhanced understanding of such attitudes requires movement beyond simple_description toward a multivariate_analysis_of_factors that affect attitudes. This comparative_study of eight different communities_in_Indiana evaluates several determinants of attitudes among residents and leaders, and provides information which can be generalized to other community situations. Attitudes toward community_change are measured_by_two_subjective_scales as: (1) personal_interest in the community, and (2) ability of the community to handle change effectively. Path analysis is used to assess the direction_and_strength of the hypothetical causal effects in the model. The findings_suggest_that_social_participation and community_attachment are most strongly associated with one's personal_interest in the community. One's evaluation of local attributes and attachment to the community are important in how one feels about the ability of the community to handle its problems. Personal characteristics, especially age and education, are of some importance. Community characteristics have only weak effects in the over-all model. Although the personal_attributes of the leaders_and_residents are very different, the results of the two models are quite similar. These findings_are_discussed_in_terms_of_the_importance of attitudes in the development_of_community policies at both the local and state/federal levels."
44328,"This research investigates posited adulthood consequences of family emotional constraint during childhood. Hypotheses follow published work in the areas of psychotherapeutic theory concerning emotional openness in one's family, the psychology of emotion, the sociology of emotional deviance, psychological_consequences_of_emotional suppression, and proposed models of interpersonal_relationships resulting from childhood_attachment experiences. This literature_suggests that a family with emotional_norms which unduly restrict children's expression of anxiety or anger may have substantial_impact on its children's expectations about interpersonal relationships. It specifically suggests that adults raised in these families will have an increased likelihood of entering psychotherapy purely as a result of self-esteem issues associated with these family experiences. The study is a questionnaire_survey utilizing a sample of 119 female_college students. The PANAS questionnaire, a mood-assessment instrument, was adapted to measure the memory of both emotional constraint during childhood and family-of-origin rules concerning emotional display. As predicted, after controlling for age, childhood_emotional constraint was found_to_be_positively_correlated with later entry into psychotherapy and with number of psychotherapy sessions, and it was found_to_be_negatively_correlated with likelihood of a secure_adult_attachment_style and with adulthood psychological health. The association with entry into psychotherapy and with adult_attachment_style also survived further statistical control for childhood level of felt negative emotion. The association with length of psychotherapy also survived those controls, as well as the additional statistical control of family-of-origin satisfaction. However, with all of these statistical controls in place, memory of childhood_emotional constraint became positively, rather than negatively, correlated with adulthood psychological health. Results are discussed_with_respect to the strong statistical confounding between level of felt_emotion and the expression of that emotion, and it is posited that an operative factor in psychological_health is the awareness, itself, of one's emotional constraint with significant others."
17806,"Critics of culture, from Max_Weber to Clifford Geertz, from Claude Levi-Strauss to James Clifford, have struggled repeatedly to generate a materialist method with which to study diverse_social forms. The philosophical_and_historical (and political) legacy of such a struggle has been mixed. On the one hand, the study of culture_emerged as an observer science, where cultural others and their productions were studied rationally and impartially by critics. This led to one-dimensional and non-reciprocal understandings of culture that failed to take into account the perspectives of those cultures under observation and of culturally situated_perspective of the social critic. On the other hand, recent studies of culture have adopted the opposite stance, suggesting that critics are not observers but participants in the interpretive art of culture. This has led to a peculiarly linguistic and relativistic understanding_of_cultural_criticism where interpretation is the only game in town (hence the preponderance of literary models in current ethnographies). When the universal science of cultural_criticism was exchanged for the local art of cultural criticism, one problematic paradigm was replaced with another, equally_problematic one. It is in the context of this unsatisfactory paradigm_shift that this study is situated. Drawing_on_the_work_of_Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, Michel_Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu, I develop the construction of constellations as a methodological alternative to the model of text and text-reading that is now commonplace in social theory. The constellation is a radical methodological relationism that takes seriously the constructed character of social fields without lapsing into relativism or linguistic reductivism. I argue that the method of constructing constellations can reflexively incorporate the observer-participant perspective of the social critic and may be linked to a descriptive_and_normative conception of truth."
10320,"Knowledge of how groups_of_people_interact is important in many disciplines, e.g. organizational behavior, social network analysis, knowledge_management and ubiquitous computing. Existing studies of social_network_interactions have either been restricted to online communities, where unambiguous measurements about how people_interact can be obtained (available from chat and email logs), or have been forced_to_rely on questionnaires, surveys or diaries to get data on face-to-face interactions between people. The aim_of_this_thesis is to automatically model face-to-face interactions within a community. The first challenge was to collect_rich and unbiased sensor_data of natural interactions. The ""sociometer"", a specially_designed wearable_sensor package, was built to address this problem by unobtrusively measuring face-to-face interactions between people. Using the sociometers, 1518 hours of wearable_sensor_data from 23 individuals was collected over a two-week period (66 hours per person). This thesis_develops_a_computational_framework_for_learning the interaction structure_and_dynamics automatically from the sociometer data. Low-level sensor_data are transformed into measures that can be used to learn socially_relevant_aspects of people's interactions--e.g. identifying when people are talking and whom they are talking to. The network_structure is learned from the patterns_of_communication among people. The dynamics of a person's interactions, and how one person's dynamics affects the other's style_of_interaction are also modeled. Finally, a person's style_of_interaction is related to the person's role within the network. The algorithms_are_evaluated_by_comparing_the_output against hand-labeled and survey data.

53371,"The subject of this dissertation is the representation and social_and_cultural uses of the ""primitive"" in written_and_visual_depictions_of_Native_Americans in the Southwest from 1880 to 1930. By examining the responses of ethnographers, photographers, writers, and artists to the Indians of New Mexico_and_Arizona the project_demonstrates how concepts of the primitive ""other"" were instrumental in the formation of cultural identities, for the nation and region, for urban middle-class Americans, and for Native Americans. The analysis_focuses on four case studies--representations of the Hopi ""Snake dance,"" publications of the Fred Harvey company, representations_of_Indian artisans, and Mary Austin's book The American Rhythm (1923)--and reveals how Indians were mythologized within the contexts of ethnography, tourism, reformist strategies like the arts and crafts movement, and modernism. Through these case studies I examine_the_prevalence of three images, or stereotypes, of Southwest Indians--as ruins, ritualists, and artisans--and I argue that these stereotypes imagined a primitive, ""vanishing"" Indian that was a locus for idealized versions of history, spirituality, and unalienated labor. In addition to discussing the content of Indian stereotypes, the project_aims_to_explore the politics of representation and reveal the ideologies that these representations reinforced and naturalized. Drawing mainly on published sources, such as articles in periodicals, tourist literature, photographs, paintings, fiction, and ethnographic materials, the analysis engages critical methodologies from several disciplines, including art history, literary_history and criticism, and anthropology; through close readings of a variety of texts, the study_shows that cultural_primitivism as practiced in the Southwest by nonIndians at the turn_of_the_century has had lasting political and cultural implications."
46180,"For most of the past century, the positive outcome of grief in the West was characterized as the relinquishment of the bond to the deceased. Phrases such as ""let go"", ""move on"", and ""get over it"" were, and continue to be, common to the language of this pursuit. This 'breaking bonds' perspective does not take into account other means of grief resolution, nor does it consider historical or cultural findings. Consequently, reports of bereaved_parents who indicate resolution_of_grief yet maintain a continued relationship with their deceased_child were not given much attention until the 1990s. This research_employed a Durkheimian approach, taking the social bond as the starting_point_of_inquiry and examined continuing bonds of parents to their murdered children. How these bonds were related to the parents' attitudes of re-investing in life and their level_of_grief was measured. The relationship between the parents' level_of_grief and their life attitudes was also assessed. The sample_consisted of 46 parents_living_in_North_Texas whose child had been murdered three or more years ago. A triangulated_methodology_was_utilized and the data were collected_by_means_of_participant observation, unstructured interviews, and a mailed_questionnaire which obtained information on continuing bonds, level of grief, life attitudes and demographic variables. Multiple_regression_techniques_were_utilized_to_analyze the quantitative data. Parents on the Continuing Bonds Scale reported_high_levels of bonds with their deceased child. Contrary to expectation, the level of continuing bonds parents maintained with their children was found_to_be_independent of other variables in the study. The relationship between parents' level_of_grief and their life attitudes was inverse in that higher_levels of grief were associated with lower_levels of re-investing in life. The finding of the independence of the Continuing Bonds Scale indicates the parent's level_of_grief and life attitudes are not related to continuing bonds; the bonds exist regardless. The relationship between level_of_grief and life attitudes points to a crisis of meaning."
43037,"A comparative_case_study_approach is used to investigate the behavior and performance of three international_organizations and their work in community forestry.

Consequently, better understanding the strengths_and_weaknesses of organizations may lead_to_the_development_of_more_effective programs. Data on traditional and community_forestry_projects were collected for the years ending fiscal_year 1986 from the World Bank, Food_and_Agriculture_Organization of the United Nations, and CARE International to determine their speed_of_movement into, commitment towards, program appropriateness of, and performance in community forestry. It was hypothesized that these dependent_variables would be influenced by the differing character, technology, structure, and environments of the three organizations. Primary and secondary_data_sources were utilized. Published and unpublished office records, documents, and archival_materials were augmented by published_literature on the organizations and community forestry. Over sixty in-depth interviews_were_held with organizational officials and independent observers. The World Bank's and FAO's commitment_to_community_forestry was low and moderate respectively, the opposite expected, while CARE International's was high. The appropriateness of the Bank's community_forestry_program was lower then expected with about 57% of its loans allocated to only one country, India. FAO and CARE were moderate and high respectively as expected. With important exceptions for each organization, the performance of World_Bank tended to be much lower than expected, FAO more variable, and CARE high.

40412,"The purpose_of_the_present_research was to address two broad_questions_related to the use of expert_testimony in battered women's homicide cases. First, what do laypersons know about battering, and in what ways is that knowledge tied to conceptually_similar_attitudinal constructs, such as sex roles, adversarial beliefs about women, and support for the use of violence against women? Second, what is the impact of expert_testimony_on_juror decision-making in a simulated battered woman's homicide case? Do prior_knowledge of domestic_violence and beliefs about the acceptability of woman-battering affect receptivity to expert_testimony or influence the decision-making process? Results from the first study_provide_preliminary_psychometric_support for the development_of_a_measure_to_assess lay knowledge of battering.

19519,"This dissertation_explores how structural_economic changes in the northeastern_United States, particularly in Philadelphia, have affected the participation of poor immigrant_Puerto_Rican_women in the labor force. Economic restructuring, based on the shift from heavily industrial to service_sector employment, has reduced the number of Puerto_Rican_women in the labor force, and has displaced them into low paid temporary and part-time jobs, unemployment, and particularly into the informal_economy_and_welfare assistance. As a response to these structural transformations, Puerto_Rican_women have also developed different types of networks to provide cooperation, mutual assistance, and emotional and material support. Furthermore, they have created new constructions of gender identity, through their new income_generating_activities and the transformation of the traditional_nuclear_family into a female_headed household. The absorption of Puerto_Rican_women in the informal_economy is associated with the consolidation of a world_economic_system_based on the New International Division of Labor. Hence, this study relates local, national_and_international shifts with the socio-economic transformations affecting the lives_and_work_experiences_of_immigrant_Puerto_Rican women. The research_approach of this study is qualitative, comprehensive and based_on_ethnographic_research tools. Data collection_techniques such as informal and semi-structured interviews, life_and_work histories, in-depth participant observation, use of native informants, collection of relevant documents, and library and archival documentation comprises the methodological_basis of this study. This research_found that the specific_ways in which Puerto_Rican_women are participating in different economic activities correspond to the declining opportunities_in_the_labor market, the rise of female_headed households, and cultural expectations about family_relations and motherhood. Cultural and economic_factors influence the types of informal economic activities in which Puerto_Rican_women decide to participate. These are mainly based on petty_commodity production, petty commerce, and services. Findings indicate that these economic activities are not new but old forms of economic production. Many first and second generation women reproduce the same subsistence and household economies in order to face_economic_constraints and transform the conditions of themselves and their families."

29443,"This paper questions whether Anglo and Mexican-American adult_children behave_and_feel differently toward their aging parents. The sample_consisted of 263 Anglo and 52 Mexican-American adult_children (N = 315) between 35 and 45 years_of_age who were of either Protestant or Catholic_religious_faith and who had at least one living parent. Subjects were selected from faculty_and_staff of two universities in Austin, Texas. Anglo and Mexican-American respondents were given a questionnaire, adapted from Cicirelli (1982) which included_information on (a) personal background; (b) family background; (c) attachment behavior (proximity of living_arrangements between adult_children and parents and frequency_of_visits and phone_calls to parents); (d) feelings_of_attachment (level of closeness, value consensus, compatibility, and perception of parents' personality traits); (e) filial_responsibility toward parents; (f) interpersonal_conflict with parents; (g) personal strain; and (h) negative_feelings in dealing with parents. The questionnaire took approximately 30 minutes to complete. The objective of the study_was_to_determine_the_level of attachment behavior and feelings_of_attachment in the relationship between the adult_children and their aging_parents across ethnic/ racial_and_gender lines. The results indicated statistically_significant_results between ethnic_groups on the two dependent variables. No differences_were_found_between_gender_groups for those two variables. The only statistically_significant variable found_to_predict_the_criterion_variable attachment behavior was filial responsibility. Adult children who have strong attitudes concerning family responsibility tend to have strong_attachment behavior_patterns toward their parents. The only statistically_significant variable to predict_the_criterion_variable feelings_of_attachment was interpersonal_conflict with parents. Adult children who experience strong conflict_with_parents are likely not to feel close, agree about things in life, be compatible, or perceive their parents' personality_traits in a positive manner. Overall, the results suggested that there are no differences in the way males and females behave_and_feel toward their mothers and fathers. However, there were differences_between_Anglo and Mexican-American adult_children on these same variables, with Mexican-American respondents living_closer to and visiting and phoning their mothers_and_fathers more frequently than did Anglo respondents.

41064,"The study_explores how a person serving as the primary family caregiver for an elder who is a first-time resident of a licensed nursing facility becomes involved in its multi-faceted social fabric. This dissertation_builds on the theoretical_framework_provided collectively by Friedemann's (1995) systemic organization of family caregiving, the skills acquisition model_of_Dreyfus_and_Dreyfus (1986) and life_satisfaction_measures introduced by Maas and Buckwalter (1993). The research_aims of this qualitative_study are to: (1) identify_elements of discovery that are typically_experienced by a primary family caregiver (PFC); (2) determine what PFCs view as ""critical turning points"" along the continuum of their social_integration into the Nursing Facility (NF) community---concentrating on the acquisition, development and effective application of new information and new relationships; (3) describe_a_model of involvement that depicts the process of a PFC's gradual_integration into, and eventual separation from, the NF community; (4) investigate how PFCs determine their criteria for self-assessment of whether they are effectively meeting their own goals as PFCs; and (5) propose possible interventions by an NF that could effectively promote a more fulfilling experience for PFCs. An NF resident's PFC commonly faces a new environment, prompting both ""fear of the unknown"" and uncertainty about how to best contribute to the welfare of his or her significant elder. The PFC's caregiving_responsibilities change, and his or her expectations about institutional_quality_of_life for the resident evolve with the lived experience. In-depth interviews conducted_with_thirty PFCs---ranging in age, gender, relationship to the resident and the resident's length of stay---reveal that a sense of familial_duty is a strong motivational influence for becoming and remaining a significant elder's PFC, and that PFC satisfaction is derived from feeling as though he or she has provided appropriately for the resident's care. A seven-phase model_is_proposed_to_illustrate how a PFCs involvement in the NF community evolves over the course of an elder's residency. The findings_suggest the need and potential for developing deeper_insight_into_the_motivations for becoming and remaining an NF resident's PFC."

Consistent with this approach, the dissertation_examines Chinese immigration to Mexico within the context of the global Chinese_diaspora of the mid-nineteenth through early_twentieth centuries, and analyzes the significant_historical_connections between Chinese migration to Mexico during these years and earlier and contemporaneous movements of Chinese_immigrants to the United States. This study_illuminates the many transnational socio-economic and political linkages that members of the Chinese colony of Mexico shared with both their home_villages and fellow compatriots in places such as the United_States and Cuba. It examines such linkages in the forms of transnational_border networks, transnational_business investments in Mexican commercial projects by wealthy Chinese_merchants of San Francisco, human_smuggling networks involving the United States, Mexico, Cuba, and Canada, the maintenance of transpacific families, and the development of Mexican branches of mainland Chinese_political organizations such as the Guamindong.

181,"This dissertation_examines Islamic collective_action and patterns of mobilization in Jordan. Some Islamic movement groups mobilize through formal, grassroots_organizations in civil society, while others operate through informal_social networks. I argue that the differing_patterns_can_be_explained by state regulative practices. The Jordanian state manipulates the administrative_apparatus to control the content of organized activities in civil society. It uses the law, permit requirements, and bureaucratic_procedures_to_ensure that organizations are not used to mount a challenge to the regime or the political system. As a result, formal_organization is more a mechanism of state control than an instrument of collective empowerment. Islamic groups, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, which do not challenge_state_power are encouraged to mobilize through formal organizations. More radical_Islamic groups, such as the Salafi movement, find organizational space limited or closed. Instead, the Salafis mobilize through personal networks based upon individuals with shared_beliefs and do not rely upon formal organizations to achieve goals. Because the Salafi networks are decentralized, segmented, and fluid, they escape the regulative capacity of the state. This perspective challenges the implicit_assumption of organizational_efficacy in social_movement_theory and points to the relevance of informal_social_networks in less open political systems."
11212,"This thesis_analyzes essays about guestworkers in the mainstream_liberal_and_conservative West_German_press between 1974 and 1984. It explores_the_ways the debate about guestworkers provided a site for working through larger_political_tensions between liberals and conservatives during a decade which (in 1982) saw the shift from Social Democratic to Christian_Democratic rule. The thesis assesses the ambiguities in the self-styled anti-racism of both sides and complicates standard_assumptions about liberals' and conservatives' relationships to ethnic difference. It also documents how consistently writing about the so-called Others provided_the_occasion for Germans' efforts to come to terms with and make_sense of themselves. Above all, it shows how important discussion of guestworkers was in Germans' own struggles with issues of economics and gender relations."

37154,"This work concerns twenty-nine (29) discrimination practices that effect the recruiting and selection of blacks as police officers. The denial of interracial occupational competition between blacks and whites, for police jobs, is a consequence of these practices. Blacks are encouraged to take increased interest in non-traditional areas of employment, such as police work, if they expect to decrease their position of economic thralldom in America. E. Franklin Frazier's ""Desegregation as an Object of Sociological Study"" provides this study's theoretical framework. The research is exploratory; the methods are multiple (ethnography, symbolic interaction, depth interview, and case study), and the overall methodological orientation is qualitative. The following hypotheses are constructed for testing: (H(,1)) Police recruiting plans that fail to attract and select blacks as policemen are characterized by (a) white control, (b) prejudice and discrimination, and (c) non-competitiveness in occupations between blacks and whites; (H(,2)) White controlled recruiting processes specifically underutilize blacks in all occupational categories; (H(,3)) Police departments having a high_degree of prejudice_and_discrimination are characterized by a paucity of race_relations policy for its employees; (H(,4)) Police departments that underutilize blacks as command officers are characterized by weak Affirmative Action Programs. Thirty-two (32) black and ten (10) white_police_officers are personally interviewed in the Denver police department. The study's salient conclusion is that a system of social inequity exists in the Denver department and is manifested by unequal_treatment of black_police_officers particulary in areas_of_disciplinary action and promotion."
5615,"According to neoliberal theorists and development practitioners, economic_liberalization_leads to increased productivity in the private sector, and decentralization and administrative reforms lead_to_greater democracy, more efficient public_sector investment, and faster local development. Combined, the economic_and_political_reforms are believed_to_result in greater overall economic_and_social efficiency. Examination of the Bolivian case, a model for neoliberal reform developed under the tutelage of Jeffrey_Sachs and World_Bank advisors, presents a different picture. To question_the_validity of the conventional neoliberal wisdom, this study looks at two laws: the Law of Capitalization, which led to the partial privatization of five industries, and the Law of Popular Participation, which combined decentralization at the municipal_level with participatory_planning and increased citizen_oversight_of_public works and spending. In the Bolivian case, privatization and economic_restructuring resulted in the need for new so-called ""economic adjustment packages"" to address budgetary shortfalls caused by loss of public_revenues_from_oil_and_gas production. Even the administrative ""democratic"" reforms have more often resulted in the entrenchment of local_elites than in increases in truly democratic control of resources and social investments. This dissertation_finds that the economic and administrative_restructuring in Bolivia combined to promote a neoliberal_agenda that not only guaranteed_access by transnational_firms to Bolivian natural resources, but also provided them the social stability necessary in which to operate. Privatization served to further open the country's borders to global capital; popular_participation served to refocus the attention of popular_movements away from national to local arenas. While the dual neoliberal agendas of lowering barriers to international_capital and simultaneously_attempting to provide the political_and_economic_stability for international_investors is apparently_contradictory when considered within the national context, in the international setting Capitalization and Popular Participation dovetail as complementary_components of globalization. This research concludes that these programs are part of an adaptive strategy by development_policy_makers to promote the stability of global_economic systems rather than equitable development, and it highlights lessons for planners and activists interested in promoting equitable development."
35256,"This qualitative_study_expands_the_current_knowledge_base behind why undergraduates pursue a doctorate in the life and physical sciences, specifically_with_regard to Mexican Americans. Hispanics make up approximately 11.7% of the United_States population, with Mexican Americans comprising almost two-thirds of this total. In 1998, of the 9,683 doctorates_awarded to U.S. citizens_and_permanent_residents in the life (biological) and physical sciences, 75 went to Mexican Americans (54 to males, 21 to females). Mexican Americans are severely_underrepresented in U.S. doctoral_programs in the life and physical sciences, as well as at earlier points in the U.S. educational system. A key aim_of_this_study_was_to_understand the underrepresentation of this population in science, and listen to Mexican Americans currently pursuing their science doctorate discuss their aspirations and experiences. In depth_interviews_were_conducted_with_twelve Mexican_American_doctoral_students in the life and physical sciences, all currently attending the same competitive research_university in California. A comparison of the backgrounds of these twelve students, along with their impetus for pursuing a graduate education, is presented. In depth portraits that chronicle_the_experiences of five of these students is also included. This study_found that a student's personal drive, career aspirations, enjoyment_of_science and research in addition to the scientist lifestyle were important variables in the decision_to_pursue a science doctorate. Involvement in research as an undergraduate was highlighted as a crucial_factor in introducing and ultimately exciting students about research careers and graduate school, and many of these students_participated in organizations at the undergraduate level, often targeted towards groups underrepresented in the sciences, that promoted scientific_research and careers. Members of the educational system, peers, and family all played important roles at various times in supporting these students in their educational_and_career aspirations. No one factor was found_to_be_essential to the pursuit of the doctorate, and each student's perspective_on_their_experiences_was_truly_unique as they discussed both their struggles and supports, and shared their evolving aspirations toward science."
17769,"This dissertation_analyzes the transformation of New York City's spatial and industrial structure from 1958 to 1992 to contest the key_tenets of post-industrial urbanism. Post-industrialism on this account cannot be understood as progressive, inevitable, or objective. Instead of the wholesale transformation being explained in post industrial terms, restructuring, economic_decline and increasing_income_inequality can all be better explained_in_terms of a new structure of accumulation: a conscious_shift to the appropriation of fictitious capital by New York's economic elites. This new mode is the most appropriate for a local elite whose economic strategy rests on the channeling and reinvestment of the outgo and income of U.S. capital export. Land monopoly and the control of financial_markets transfer surplus value without the need to create any by means of the labor process. New York's ""restructuring"" process serves as the test case. It has been urban America's most radical: once the largest_manufacturing city, it now has the highest_ratio of employment in finance, insurance_and_real_estate (FIRE) to manufacturing. And while other U.S. cities merely sought_to_expand their central_business districts (CBD's), New York's planners not only created a second downtown CBD, they also sought to implant ""regional sub-centers"" throughout the outer-boroughs. These comprehensive_planning_efforts preceded by as much as two decades, the regional_and_global events that are usually invoked_to_explain ""restructuring."" By almost any broad measure, planning_efforts have been disastrous: the city has the U.S.'s lowest employment/population ratio, the lowest over-all labor_force_participation rate and the lowest youth_labor_force_participation rate by far. Its housing production stands below Peoria's. New York is also substantially_worse off than before it began the transformation in all these areas plus many other social indicators, e.g., welfare dependence has increased by 300%; ""economic"" crimes like robbery by 2,000%; official_poverty by almost 50%."
32388,"In the research regarding family and fertility, little attention has been paid to the couple unit. The majority of fertility studies have focused upon the wife only. Where data are available for both husband and wife, it is often clustered under the headings ""males"" and ""females;"" again ignoring the specific husband_and_wife dyad. In addition, the attitudes of husbands_and_wives are often assumed to be essentially the same. This study investigates couple agreement on desired_family size. The following hypotheses are examined. (1) Agreement on desired_family_size is related to similarity of background; the more homogeneous the couple in their background characteristics, the more they are likely to agree on their family_size desires. (2) Agreement on desired_family_size will be greater among those who have discussed their family_size_desires and goals than among those who have not. (3) The longer the duration of the family of procreation, the greater will be the agreement concerning family_size preference between husbands and wives. The study_is_based on the secondary_analysis_of_data from the New Orleans Family_Survey of 1965. The data are from a subsample of 357 couples. Separate interviews_were_held with husband and wife; their responses_to_the_survey_questions were subsequently compared. The data concerning demographic_homogeneity are inconsistent. Sometimes those similar in characteristics agree more highly on family_size_preferences than those dissimilar in characteristics; sometimes they do not. The zero order relationships are weak, rarely manifesting chi squares large enough to reject chance. Multiple regression of the twenty-six explanatory_variables indicates homogeneity on these variables explains only fourteen_percent_of_the_variance in agreement on desired_family size. Discussion of family_size also yields inconclusive data. Couples who have discussed family_size_preferences indicated a slightly_higher_percent_agreement than did those who had not discussed preferences. The highest_percent_agreement was shown, however, among couples who disagreed concerning whether they had ever discussed family_size preferences. Length of marriage was found to have no relationship to agreement on desired_family size. In all, the data_show a high_percent of disagreement concerning family_size_preferences among the couples; slightly over sixty_percent of the couples disagree. This indicates that researchers should be cautious in interpreting information from one spouse as indicative of the opinions of the other. In addition, spouses who are homogeneous in characteristics should not be assumed_to_be_homogeneous in outlook."

46566,"This study_explores trade in northern Japan, predominantly on the island of Hokkaido, between the Japanese and the native Ainu during the Tokugawa_period (1600-1868). It highlights_the_role that ecological change, epidemic diseases, and ""reinvented"" ritual traditions played in the breakdown of Ainu autonomy and Japan's conquest of Ainu lands. By focusing on the role of ecology and culture in the conquest of Ainu lands, this study promises to identify early_modern forms of Japanese colonialism, while introducing a broader East_Asian perspective to the study of eighteenth-century Japan, a period still referred to as the ""Closed Country"" by some historians. Moreover, rather than view Hokkaido as the ""frontier"" of the Tokugawa polity, ""open lands"" ripe for development, I approach the topic_from_the_perspective of Ainu and the local ecology, as well as the Japanese. I assert that the roots of the Japanese_colonization of Hokkaido lay in changes in Ainu productive systems, ritual traditions, and the local environment, all sparked by the normalization of trade with Matsumae domain. The theoretical_approach used in this study resembles recent studies of the American_West by historians such as Patricia Limerick and Richard White. I have also been influenced by recent environmental_historians such as William_Cronon and Alfred Crosby. The research was completed under a Fulbright Fellowship at the Research_Center for Northern Studies, Wokkaido University Library. I also benefited from archives at the Hokkaido Prefectural Library, and the Hakodate Municipal Library, all located in Japan. This study, aside from refuting conventional_assumptions about the present shape of the Japanese archipelago, complicates the notion of Japanese homogeneity and the relationship between culture and ecology. It also questions the basic_idea of a singular, ethnic-based ""Japanese"" cultural order and historical_narrative in the geographic_space today called Japan."
990,"Parent training is considered, among professionals, to be an important treatment component for children with Attention_Deficit_Hyperactivity_Disorder (ADHD). Historically, behavioral_coaching has been used for training_parents_of_children exhibiting behavioral_difficulties (e.g. opposition, noncompliance or behaviors associated with developmental delay) to ensure generalization_and_maintenance of new techniques. Behavioral coaching involves modeling, role-play, in vivo practice with the child and direct feedback from the therapist based on observations. These techniques have been proven_effective across many training_content_areas such as for parents, teachers, staff_in_sales or customer_service and other areas. To date, the majority of existing studies of training for parents_of_ADHD_children include limited training techniques, minimal or no behavioral coaching. The current_study was a component_analysis to evaluate whether behavioral_coaching_strategies enhanced parent-child more so than didactic_training alone with parents of school-aged children_diagnosed with ADHD. The entire treatment_package was first presented_didactically (Package A) then with behavioral_coaching (Package B). Four parent-child dyads_completed multiple assessments throughout the study including child rating scales, parent self-report scales and parent-child interaction observation sessions. A fifth parent-child pair withdrew during the initial_stages of treatment due to illness. Observational data were based on the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction_Coding_System (DPICS-II). With observational data, all four dyads demonstrated_enhanced improvements in interactions following coaching, more so than with didactic techniques alone.

Some of these couples seek help from marriage_and_family therapists, but many therapists claim they are not well trained in the issues_facing these couples.

This study combined both approaches. Dual-earner couples whose children were grown and who identified themselves as having great marriages reflected on strategies that helped them develop and maintain successful and satisfying marriages.

15365,"The purpose_of_this_study_was_to_understand what is considered a good_quality mother-daughter relationship in Korea from the perspectives of mothers_and_their_young_adult daughters, and to explore how the indigenous_themes of interdependency, filial piety, and emphasis on educational_excellence as an expression of filial piety, are reflected in the perceptions of the mothers_and_their_young_adult daughters. The interview_data_collected by Melson et al. (2002) in Korea were used for analysis. Participants_included 29 daughters between the ages of 20 to 36 and their biological_mothers between the ages of 46 to 69. Both mothers and daughters were from the Seoul, Korea. Mothers were asked_to_describe their relationship with their daughters from the time of the daughters' birth. Daughters were asked_to_describe their relationship with their mothers from their earliest memories of their mothers. The results_revealed their different perceptions of their experiences and relationships as well as their commonalities. The filial_piety findings_revealed that the Korean_mothers had strong filial_piety_expectations and expected obedience from their daughters. The results also showed that the mothers' filial_piety_expectations of their daughters were strong but their interdependency expectations were very low. Mothers were also shown to be the source of the dynamic energy promoting young women's career aspirations. As they raised their daughters, they stressed the importance of women having their own career in today's society and passed on their values to their daughters. Most mothers and daughters in the study expressed great satisfaction with their relationship with each other. Conflict often occurred when the mother took an individualistic_approach to her parenting. In most cases, both mother and daughter were changing together, but when there was conflict it was often when one of the pair did not accept the change. In Korean_society there is a deep-rooted emphasis on conformity and not being different. Korean daughters seemed to use social_comparison_influences on judging the quality of parenting."
15406,"The purpose_of_this_study_was_to_investigate whether clergy respond to intimate_partner_violence using a ""marriage-first"" or ""safety-first"" approach. A ""marriage-first"" approach_focuses on keeping the marriage together, while a ""safety-first"" approach indicates a willingness to emphasize safety even if it ultimately ends the marriage. Clergy attitudes about women's roles, victim blaming attitudes, amount_of_training received, rating of training received, and their level_of_endorsement of fundamentalist_beliefs were expected_to_influence clergy response. Self-administered surveys were sent to 268 clergy in the Midwest, but N = 151 surveys were used in the analysis. Clergy are from various religious and socioeconomic backgrounds, including male and female. A feminist_perspective_guided the methodology. Results reveal that using a vignette with intimate_partner_violence clergy respond in either a ""marriage-first"" approach or ""safety-first"" approach. Lethality of the violence did not make_a_significant_difference in their response. Using multiple_regression_analyses the findings_show that 49% percent_of_the_variance in ""marriage-first"" was accounted for by race, victim blaming attitudes for spousal physical violence, fundamentalist beliefs, and traditional views of women's roles. Being African American, endorsing higher fundamentalist beliefs, having more traditional views of women's roles, and higher victim blaming attitudes for physical_violence_against_women had a significant_association with a ""marriage-first"" response. Further analysis of these variables_identified a negative_and_significant correlation between being African_American and having a M.Div. There were significant_positive relationships between African Americans and being married, having traditional views of women's roles, and having higher fundamentalist beliefs. A ""safety-first"" approach was significantly associated with less years as clergy, and having less traditional views of women's roles. They accounted for 26% of the variance for ""safety-first."" This study_identified_two_distinct_ways that clergy respond_to_victims_of_intimate_partner_violence (""marriage-first"" and ""safety-first""), training did not affect either, fundamentalist_beliefs affected a ""marriage-first"" response, while attitudes about women's roles (egalitarian vs. traditional) affected both responses.

25190,"The dissertation_investigates on the effects of electoral_politics on the distribution of government_outlays for three social_welfare_programs in Mexico in the period of democratic transition, using political_business cycles and distributive politics models. The first essay makes a critical_review of the two most widely used theoretical models to explain the political component on the distribution of policy benefits: the political_business_cycle and distributive politics. I jointly test the implications of these theories on a specific federal_poverty_alleviation program in Mexico (FONAES) using monthly_time_series and state panel_data on federal outlays for a decade in which electoral_pressures rose systematically. Using the same framework the second essay compares various poverty_alleviation programs. I explain how program allocation_rules have evolved in the poverty_alleviation strategy during two and a half_decades in Mexico and why these changes that appear to limit political manipulation might not necessarily have the desire effect. With administrative data from a set of government_agencies on different programs I estimate similar models to those specified in the previous paper to test whether different allocation_rules represent changes in the political bias. For the final_essay 0I use municipal_level information on a decentralized social program in order_to_test for the effects_of_decentralization on the politics of distribution. The main_findings on this research are, first, that policy_instruments for distribution of federal outlays for social_welfare_programs in Mexico are still highly influenced by electoral politics. Second, timing resources to elections has been less evident as a political strategy due to the gradual_implementation of programs or to decentralization. Third, allocation is still highly influenced by partisan considerations. Former opposition_parties have succeeded in increasing their share of resources as vote for their party increases. Fourth, decentralization has affected the power_balance as party_affiliation of state_governors is now relevant for distribution at the municipal level."
4964,"Teenagers engage in an expanding variety of interpersonal contacts with increasing independence from the familial context. One aspect of this developing social_realm is confronting conflict. Conflict resolution strategy reflects adolescents' social skill capacity and the extent to which they can integrate skills in a typical but trying situation. The current_study investigates the contribution of observed and self-reported social_skills to conflict_resolution ability in three contexts. Longitudinal associations between social ability (communication, assertiveness, anxiety, and aggression) and conflict_resolution strategy in role-play interactions_involving a parent, peer, and teacher are examined. The associations between conflict_resolution ability and general indicators_of_social competence, including confidence in social interactions, school engagement, and rule-abiding behavior, are also examined. The current_investigation examines_the_process_of_conflict_resolution mastery of 177 adolescents during their 6 th and 7 th grade years. Of these New York_City_public_and_parochial school students, 57.1% were Black, 29.4% Latino, and 9.6% White; gender was equally distributed. Overall, Social ability and conflict_resolution ability changed little between 6 th and 7 th grade. Seventh graders showed better skills with peers than with adults. Findings suggest that social_skills associated with conflict_resolution are context-specific. With a parent, 6 th grade communication skill was associated with later use of compromise or negotiation (exp&#946; = 2.82). Less-skilled communication at 6 th grade increased the likelihood that adolescents offered reasons to resolve conflict with a parent at 7 th grade (exp&#946; = .36). Negotiating with a peer at 7 th grade was more likely among adolescents who were assertive 6 th graders (exp&#946; = 1.65). Though adolescents consistently demonstrating solution-based resolution with parents_and_peers were better communicators than their agemates (e.g. 6 th grade parent communication, M = 3.37 versus 2.91), overall they show less ability over time (e.g. parent communication M = 3.37, then 3.08). The association of solution-seeking strategy with a teacher and school_engagement was the only connection between adolescent_conflict_resolution and global indicators_of_social competence. Implications for skills-based prevention_curricula are discussed."
49103,"The present_study_attempted_to_replicate_and_extend_prior_work of Cannon, Mednick, and Parnas (1990) suggesting a model whereby autonomically hyper-responsive high-risk children who are exposed to early_life_stress are at elevated_risk for adult schizophrenia in which positive-symptoms predominate. In a prospective high-risk sample of 72 subjects, we examined the interaction between early_childhood stressful_life_events and two measures of autonomic_nervous_system responsivity in the prediction of adult reality_distortion (delusions and hallucinations). We observed a significant_effect for number of responses to orienting trials in combination with early_life stress, but no significant_interaction involving ANS average_half recovery rate. Contrary to predictions, we observed a pattern wherein higher_levels_of_life_stress were associated with elevated_risk for adult reality_distortion among ANS non-responders, but not among subjects_with_normal or high ANS responsiveness. We also observed significant relationships between early_life_stress and ratings of children's subsequent anxiety, social extroversion, and general competence.

46423,"After being defined as one of the most wretched of all human species in the nineteenth century, popular news_magazines heralded Chinese as one of the nation's ""Model Minorities"" in the mid-1960s.

This study_traces the depictions of Chinese in popular_periodicals from their earliest_arrival through the 1930s. Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature, the San_Francisco Newspaper Index, and the New York_Times_Index supply the titles for the articles from which images of Chinese are extracted. Secondary sources on race_relations and the Chinese and African_American experiences provide_information for a historical context. Findings indicate the shift to more favorable depictions of Chinese began_in_the_late 1920s. By 1940 the foundation for the ""Model Minority"" was firmly in place. The demise of biologistic definitions of racial_differences and the subsequent_rise of a social_definition made this transition possible. Within sociology, the emergence of the assimilation_theory_corresponds with this shift. Through an analysis of studies on the actual position of the Chinese_in_the_United_States during this period, we find more positive_depictions that emerged were less a reflection of actual changes in the status of the Chinese vis-a-vis whites than the proliferation of the social_definition of race (and the accompanying racial ideology, assimilation theory, race_relations cycle, etc.) which argues that such changes are not only possible, but desirable and inevitable. Theoretically the study challenges_the_predominant understanding of ""race relations"" as part of an ecological process of ""assimilation."" It contributes to an alternative understanding of particular races as part_of_a_larger ""racial formation""--which is a dynamic complex of racial meanings, structured at both the micro-level (identities) and macro-level (institutions).

4352,"This study_investigated the experiences of 133 men and women, who worked full_time and cared for a frail parent. Many aspects of the employee caregivers life were examined: the work experience, the caregiving experience, the interactional effects of work and parent care, the level of family_and_community support, and the quality of the employee caregiver's relationship with the parent. These variables_were_examined_in_relation to the following outcome measures: the employee caregiver's future_commitment to care for an aging parent; the physical_and_mental strain of combining work and parent care; and its impact on employment. For the most part, validated scales and indexes were used to measure the independent_and_dependent variables. Major_findings_revealed that, in spite of any personal or practical costs to employee caregivers, they were firmly committed to providing care, as the parents' needs increased. The interactional effects of balancing_work and parent care, as measured by role_strain and the number_of_negative_life changes experienced, as a result of caregiving, predicted the caregivers' physical_and_mental strain. The number of work interferences (unscheduled days off, tardiness, and excessive telephoning), due to parent care duties, were determined by the closeness of the adult_child_and_parent relationship, and by the caregiver's involvement in parent care. Respondents with the heaviest caregiving responsibilities, reported the most work interferences. And respondents with the closest relationships were the most willing to take time away from work to care for their parents. Support from family and friends, as well as the supervisor, buffered some of the negative_consequences of performing the joint roles.

It was found_that_girls returned to school to attend a program, and it seemed that a high-school-based program_provided comprehensive service to teenage_mothers and their children. The importance of a program providing_a_nurturing_environment was found to be an essential factor. Subgroups of mothers according to educational need were found. Many girls had serious remedial_education problems requiring the educational component to be flexible and staffed by qualified remedial teachers. An integrated program with the public_school is recommended, including education, day care, parenting education, and counseling. A preschool preventive curriculum utilizing Headstart is a possible approach_to_teaching_children about human_relationships and sexuality."

16815,"This is a comparative_study of the behavior and attitudes_of_middle_school_teachers in Japan and the US. The findings_challenge_a_commonly_held assumption among Americans that grade schools in Japan are more academically oriented; at least it shows that Japanese teachers_spend a smaller_fraction of their work_day teaching academic subjects. Teachers in twelve middle schools, six in the US and six in Japan, were selected for the study. Survey and field_work methods were employed. In total, 137 American and 173 Japanese teachers returned questionnaires. Extensive field_work included_interviews with teachers, administrators, and parents, as well as classroom observations. The data reveal that American teachers_spend a significantly_larger_proportion of their work time on academic_tasks than Japanese teachers and Japanese teachers_spend_a_larger_proportion of their work time on student-related tasks than American teachers. Japanese teachers also spend relatively more time on school management and meetings. The study_shows key structural differences between middle schools in the two countries in school organization, particularly the curriculum, staffing patterns, class_size and school environment, that relate to teachers' work behavior. The study also shows fundamental_differences between Japanese and US teachers in their views of teaching. Teaching is a ""profession"" in both countries. In Japan, however, a teacher is seen as a generalist with diffuse responsibilities while in the United_States a teacher is seen as a specialist. These divergent conceptions_of_teaching are consistent with behavioral and structural differences between the two systems. The findings_of_this_study_contribute to institutional studies on school_organization by demonstrating the institutional effects emanating in different societies on teachers' work and views of teaching. The results_imply that solutions to students' academic_performance cannot be found within school alone. At a minimum, broader_social beliefs_about_the_role of schools need to be taken into account."
15758,"This research program investigated discrimination in the solo situation as it applies to gender (e.g., a single woman in a group of men). Two studies_compared_female_and_male solos on female- and male-stereotyped group tasks across three group gender compositions. In each study, six-person groups met to plan a campus fundraiser event. Each group included either one, two, three, four, or five females. In the one- and two-female conditions, one of the women was a confederate; in the four- and five-female conditions, one of the men was a confederate. In the gender-balanced (three women and three men) condition, half of the balanced groups included a male confederate, and half included a female confederate. The solo was always a confederate. The research measured how subjects_behaved toward the confederates by coding and analyzing videotapes of the group interactions and utilizing a post-interaction questionnaire. Both unfavorable (negative) and favorable (positive) bias was measured. Subjects' treatment of the confederates was compared between solo and nonsolo conditions_to_determine whether solo_status or social_status (i.e., gender) was causing solo effects observed in past_studies lacking a nonsolo control group. The project design also tested the effects of the interaction of solo gender with task gender stereotype, a previously_untested variable in this area. Results did not support prior solo research. No evidence_of_discrimination against gender solos, per se, was found. Instead, the group_gender_composition that produced_the_highest_incidence of both negative_and_positive gender_bias was that in which one other member was the same gender as the confederate (group gender_composition 2:4). Both confederate_gender and the gender stereotype of the group_task_also_influenced the group interaction. Overall, when the group_task was male-stereotyped, female confederates experienced_negative discrimination. When the group_task was female-typed, female confederates continued to experience_negative_bias and male confederates received_positive bias, despite the task gender stereotype. Male confederates also experienced_negative discrimination for the female-typed task. It was concluded that gender, not solo status, caused the effects obtained in previous solo research."

33181,"This study provides an overview of many aspects of the experience_of_parental_death within the American population, utilizing data_from_the_National_Survey_of_Families and Households, a large, stratified, random, nationally_representative_survey (n = 13,017). This study investigates the incidence of parental death, the characteristics of the recently bereaved, the influence_of_parental_loss on various family relationships, and the characteristics of those at highest_risk for experiencing_symptoms_of_depression following a parent's death. One of every forty adults in this study was found to experience a parent's loss annually. The recently_bereaved were significantly more likely to be male, married, Black, older, and to have not received any social_support in the month preceding the interview. In this study, depressive_symptomatology was not associated with the experience of a parent's death. However, among the recently bereaved, depressive_symptoms_were_found_to_be_significantly_higher among women, the young, the less educated and less healthy, the non-Hispanic, those who had received_social_support in the previous month and those who, at age 16, had not lived with the recently_deceased parent. The number of surviving parents was significantly associated with conflict and closeness with siblings and contact_and_closeness with parents. This research represents one of the few nationally_representative studies on parental_death to include adequate_control variables. The null_findings with respect to parental_death and depression suggest that for most people, loss_of_a_parent does not result in serious mental_health consequences. However, the relationship_between_parental_death and relationship_quality suggests that other outcomes such as grief, relationship quality, and the accomplishment of developmental mid-life tasks may be more relevant foci than depression for future_research in the area."
46381,"This project investigated the impact of subthreshold_neglect on the security and organization of infant-mother attachment bonds. Subthreshold neglect was defined as poor_parenting that was not severe enough to mandate involvement of child protection agencies. On average, teen_mothers were more neglectful than low-resource and high-resource adult mothers; however, the rates of insecure and disorganized_attachment did not differ_significantly between teens and adults. Across all groups, subthreshold_neglect of children's developmental advance and emotional needs was associated with insecure infant-mother attachment. Specifically, mothers who were more neglectful were more likely to have children with an insecure-avoidant attachment pattern. Subthreshold neglect was not associated with the disorganization of the attachment bond. Results are discussed_in_terms_of_differences between subthreshold and substantiated child_neglect as well as implications_for_intervention_and_prevention with subthreshold neglect."
35810,"The dissertation is a study of psychiatric_and_psychological assessments of juveniles coming before the juvenile courts in London, England. The central_research_question is: what are the behavioural and interactional bases of psychiatrists' and psychologists' assessments of juveniles? The dissertation_seeks to link the professional judgments and claims of psychiatrists and psychologists (the texts of assessment reports) to the specific_interactions that they have with the juveniles concerned. The principal_findings may be summarised as follows: (1) The professional assessments of the psychiatrists and psychologists, as they appear in the texts of their reports to the juvenile courts, are highly_selective in terms of what is available for comment in the interaction of assessment meetings. (2) In making their selective textual summaries of children the psychiatrists and psychologists rely_heavily on categorisation procedures which 'frame' the children's behavioral and interactional performances during the assessment in inclusive and exclusive ways. The basis of the categories used are conventional in that they occasion common-sense knowledge about activities and characteristics which, by convention, are seen as typical of persons in that category. Accordingly, the written assessments of psychiatrists and psychologists are seen as partial, typified and category bound, rather than based on the unique particulars of the individual child. (3) Despite the claims of psychological testing to be based on test standardisation, uniformity of procedure and the attainment of objective knowledge, each of these principles are violated in practice. This is attributable to the social and interactional nature of psychological testing rather than the incompetence of the tester. The form of a child's performance in testing, as well as the content, are important for purposes of test scoring and the psychologist's interpretation of test responses. (4) The interpretation of projective test responses is less 'objective' than early_proponents of the approach had suggested and under detailed_analysis can be seen as rather speculative. Accordingly, the written_reports of the psychologist are similarly speculative in parts. (5) Both the psychiatrists' and the psychologists' written_reports are 'recipient designed'. That is to say, their content and phrasing are edited and designed_to_suit the (presumed) interests and expectations of those who might read them. This further calls_into_question the extent to which these reports reflect the individual_characteristics of the children assessed as these are displayed in the interaction of assessment meetings."
50886,"Evidence of normative_influence on health behavior has been broadly identified; however, issues regarding the mechanism, transmission and enforcement of norms remain to be understood. Drawing from Giddens' (1984) Theory of Structuration, Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation (1983), and Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory (1983), this dissertation_examines the mediating roles of cost-benefit judgments, interpersonal_communication_and_social sanctions in the norms-behavior and norms-intention relations. Specifically, this study_proposes that group_norms indirectly impact behavior or intention by affecting the ways that group_members judge behaviors. In addition, normative_messages are shared through the process_of_interpersonal_communication and norms become effective when they are enforced through social sanctions. An online_survey of over 500 students from various student organizations in a major_university was conducted_to_determine_the_influence_of_group_norms_on_drinking_behavior and intention. Results of structural_equation_modeling indicated that perceived benefit of drinking was positively associated with drinking intention and behavior. The perceived benefit also fully_mediated the norm-intention and norm-behavior relations. The perceived cost resulting from drinking, however, was not a significant predictor of either drinking intention or behavior. Both social reward_and_punishment had positive direct effects on drinking intention and are significant mediators of norms and drinking intention, but not of actual_drinking behavior. Communication patterns fully_mediated both the norms-behavior and norms-intention relations. These mediation findings_suggest that: (1) the norms-intention relationship will not be well established without the process_of_social sanctions; (2) the influence_of_group_norms on both behavior and intention depend on the perceived benefit of judgment on drinking and the level of communication about drinking among group members. These results have significant importance for the effective design of public_health campaigns."
14855,"My dissertation_makes three important contributions to the development_of_the_concept_of_social capital. The first contribution provides a systematic theoretical_framework within which to study social capital. This framework builds on the understanding that the most important_dimension of social_capital is the institutionalization of generalized attitudes such as trust and norms of reciprocity. I identify three important areas in social_capital research that suffer from insufficient theorizing and a lack_of_empirical research. These areas are (1) the study of the causes of institutionalization of generalized_trust or lack thereof, (2) the building and testing of a micro-theory of social_capital that elucidates the relationship between associational membership and generalized trust; and (3) the study of the consequences of the institutionalization of generalized trust. The additional contributions of my dissertation to the concept_of_social_capital include empirical investigations in two of the three proposed_research areas, the findings of which greatly modify and challenge_current_assumptions in social_capital research. The second contribution pertains to the critical assumption in social_capital_theory that memberships in voluntary_associations foster generalized trust. The problem with this assumption is that no empirical_proof of this relationship exists, as the research_to_date has suffered from endogeneity problems, the lack_of_relevant_data on group memberships, and the lack_of_a_coherent micro-theory of social capital. In this dissertation, I provide the first empirical test of this important hypothesis with a unique self-collected data_set that overcame most of the aforementioned problems. My findings_verify our common_understanding as developed by social_capital research about the connection between membership_in_voluntary_associations and trust, but they do not verify strongly that these types_of_interactions are causes for trust. In my third contribution_to_social_capital theory, I went beyond the importance of voluntary_associations to examine the sources of generalized_trust outside of the group life, in regional settings. Recent_explanations for differences_in_regional social_capital emphasize static or path-dependent development patterns_of_social capital. However, in an investigation of three Swedish regions, I examined how contemporary regional factors contribute to facilitating or hampering the development of regional stocks of social capital. In particular, I emphasize the potential of current aspects of local_government to influence citizens' generalized trust. The findings of both of my empirical investigations have major_implications for the building and development_of_social_capital theory."
18085,"The literature_suggests that there are a number_of_factors which produce aggression or nurture the development of aggressive_tendencies in children; foremost among these are frustration and physical discipline. This study_focuses_on_the_relationship between frustration, history_of_parental punishment, and parental_authoritarianism on aggression in 7-10 year old children. Depending on the hypothesis, aggression was operationally-defined as (a) the child's score on the Aggressive Scale of the Child_Behavior_Checklist (CBCL) or (b) the type_and_amount of punishment subjects_chose for fictional children in vignettes of common parent-child conflict situations. Parents also participated in the vignette portion_of_the_study and children's and parents' scores were compared. 102 children_and_their_parents_participated in the study. While parents filled out measures (e.g. regarding authoritarianism, family discipline) in another room, children_completed their own measures and were then put through an arithmetic exercise during which they were either frustrated or were not. Following this, they viewed overhead slides_depicting common parenting situations which might require parental_discipline of a child. Subjects were asked to play the parent_and_the_type_and_amount of punishment they might deliver. It was expected that frustration and more punitive_discipline history would increase children's aggressive_responding and that children high in punishment history and with authoritarian parents would be rated as more aggressive, generally. These main_hypotheses were not supported; however children with more severe punishment histories were significantly more punitive toward the child in the vignette, confirming a secondary hypothesis. Several unpredicted age_differences were present, one involving a differential effect of frustration for older subjects, but not for younger."
7964,"Spirituality has been a consistent stress_buffering mechanism for Black people throughout their history in America. Past research_shows that John Henryism, or constant and active_coping with environmental challenges, has complex connections to health for Black people.

A second goal_was_to_determine if the respective relationships of spirituality, John Henryism, and daily_hassles with somatic_symptoms are significant when adjusting_for_socioeconomic_status (SES) and gender. The sample_comprised_a_population of 203 (78 male, 125 female) Black_college_students in introductory_psychology courses. Small groups_of_students filled out the John_Henryism Scale of Active Coping, the Spirituality Scale, the Combined Hassles and Uplifts Scale, the Symptoms Checklist 90-R, and a demographic questionnaire. A hierarchical_multiple_regression_analysis_included SES, gender, spirituality, John Henryism, and daily_hassles as predictors and self-reported somatic_symptoms as the criterion variable. The results indicate that the overall sample is in good somatic health, daily_hassles significantly predict somatic symptoms, and that spirituality does not moderate the respective relationships of hassles and John_Henryism with somatic symptoms, and that John_Henryism is positively_and_significantly_correlated with spirituality. The results_suggest that hassles play_a_major_role in self-reports of somatic symptoms, that sociodemographic, cultural, and coping factors are evasive and potentially complex when examining self-perceptions of somatic health, that the measure of John_Henryism may tap a culturally-based belief system, and that more complex assessments of the role of adaptive cultural_resources such as spirituality and coping styles such as John_Henryism are needed when studying the role_of_psychosocial_stress in the somatic_health of Black populations."
42242,"The purpose_of_this_study is to compare levels of acculturation of Puerto_Rican_college_students in Puerto_Rico and the United States. The research_population_consisted of 372 Puerto_Rican_college students. One-hundred and twelve (30%) were males and two-hundred and sixty (70%) were females.

Puerto_Rican_males in Puerto_Rico did not score higher on the masculinity sub-scale of the Bem_Sex_Role_Inventory than did Puerto_Rican_males in the United States. Puerto_Rican_males who scored_high in the masculinity sub-scale did not score high on the acculturation scale. Puerto_Rican_males who perceived themselves as racially lighter on the Racial Identification Scale did not score higher on the Cultural_Life_Style Scale. Subjects who perceived the Racial Identification slides as lighter also identified themselves as lighter. Subjects who identified themselves as darker also perceived the slides as being darker. The category of 'Mixed' was most often used by Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico. Perceptions about definitions of skin_color differ for Puerto_Ricans_in_Puerto_Rico and the United States. The continuum of color_variation does not exist in the United_States as in Puerto Rico. Because of the high importance placed on skin_color in the United_States and Puerto Rico, the study of perceptions of skin_color needs the attention of researchers.

35344,"The process of urbanism often involves rural_communities relocating to emerging_urban centers. These immigrant communities experience forces that challenge their indigenous community structures and belief systems. Ethnogenesis, the process_of_creating group identities is likely to occur given the changes that correlate with urbanism. Data from the Pre-Hispanic settlements of the Chicama Valley, Peru are used to examine_the_role of ethnogenesis in the context_of_emerging urbanism. Settlement pattern studies show that between the Gallinazo and Early Moche cultural phases (1-200 C.E.) sites shifted from one of up-valley villages_to_nucleated habitation around the site of Mocollope, in the central lower-valley. Changes that correlate with urbanism and encourage ethnogenesis include: (1) increase in population density; (2) increases in economic exchange; (3) increases in the degree of specialization; and (4) increases in the degree of social_hierarchy and centralized control. Stylistic expression is used as a proxy to measure community_identity through time. Domestic pottery style of the Castillo Incised ware was examined from five Gallinazo period rural village_sites and compared to the same ware found at Mocollope. The assemblage at Mocollope was divided into six Urban Zones. Stylistic motifs are coded as attribute values, allowing for comparison using relative percentages and chi-square analyses. Four hypotheses are presented and tested. (H 1 ) The stylistic_patterns identified at the rural_communities maintain themselves within the urban site, reflecting immigrant barrios formed by people from the same village. (H 2 ) New stylistic expressions are found at Mocollope, reflecting new communities within the larger_urban center. (H 3 ) New stylistic expressions arise, but they correlate to differences in wealth between groups. And (H 4 ) one single pan-urban style is found which is shared by all residents of the new city. Results show no evidence for H 4 . No evidence_of_wealth could be used to address H 3 . There is evidence for both H 1 and H 2 . In three of five cases the indigenous expression of rural_communities has changed in response to the new urban environment. In two of five cases rural_villages maintained their stylistic expression and, presumably, are maintaining social identity."
51971,"This study developed_and_tested a model of midlife women's attainments, commitments and satisfactions under differing conditions of marriage and parenthood. The model proposed that life_satisfaction for women is a function of three sets of influences: (1) adult_status attainments, (2) home_and_work commitments, and (3) home_and_work satisfactions. These three sets of influences, in turn, are a function of three predetermined and correlated conditions: (1) health, (2) early_childhood status and (3) educational attainment. The model_was_developed using data_from_a_cohort of midlife_women drawn_from_the_National_Survey_of_Families and Households. The model was then tested on subsamples from that cohort using LISREL 7. Tests of the model revealed both similarities_and_differences in the processes of attainment of life_satisfaction for all midlife women, for those with and without husbands, and for those with and without children. In tests of the individual models, health and satisfaction with one's role at home were the primary_factors_influencing life_satisfaction for women. Work commitment was also a significant, and negative, predictor. Tests of the model across stacked groups, however, failed_to_clarify specific structural differences_due to marital or parental status.

2370,"This study examines longitudinal self-reports of adolescent_suicidal_ideation using Durkheim's dimensions of regulation and integration at the micro-level and Bronfenbrenner's ecological model. Predictor variables include 3 dimensions of the mother-child relationship (support, behavioral control, and psychological control), and measures representing adolescent_social_contexts such as teacher support, religious support, deviant_peer associations, and neighborhood disorganization. Few studies have attempted a simultaneous examination of multiple_domains of predictive_factors of adolescent suicidal ideation. Structural equation analyses reveal that separate_dimensions_of_parenting behavior have differing associations with suicidal ideation; thus, reinforcing the value of assessing parenting_dimensions independently. Self-derogation and deviant_peer associations have the most frequent significant associations with suicidal_ideation for all subcategories. Additional_analyses indicate 2-way interaction_effects between adolescent_social_contexts with some diverging results for boys and girls. Mother behavioral_control is a protective factor for younger_adolescents but a risk factor for older adolescents. Latent change analyses and multi-wave longitudinal_analyses were also conducted and results indicate that self-derogation, deviant_peer association, mother psychological_control_and_mother_behavioral_control are important factors which account for change in the levels of adolescent_suicidal_ideation over time. Finally, proximal factors such as self-derogation and familial variables have stronger longitudinal_associations with suicidal_ideation than distal factors."

46260,"This dissertation re-examines the sources of the prolonged stability of the Mexican_political_system by investigating local politics and the pattern of insertion of local communities into national politics. It is argued that the local_government (the ayuntamiento) is a key institution whose control by the PRI-government apparatus has contributed_to_the_political_stability of the system. It has been used as an instrument of domination with multiple functions: to keep local demands low, to reinforce the corporative organizations of the PRI, to facilitate the proper functioning of the state_and_federal bureaucratic_agencies that operate at the local level, to guarantee a high_percentage_of_votes for the PRI, and to limit the development of the opposition. Through a quantitative_and_qualitative_analysis of the municipios of the state_of_Oaxaca it is argued that the process of socioeconomic modernization is creating a new configuration of forces which challenges the traditional mechanisms of political control of the national_political system. The quantitative_analysis consists of an examination of the statistical_relationship_between_socioeconomic_variables and the emergence of local_political conflict. This part of the analysis supports the claim that the emergence_of_political protests is associated with socioeconomic changes at the local level. Qualitative analysis of the extra-local relations of the municipios is based on research reports and new data_gathered_by_the_author in field work. The analysis leads to the identification of three different types_of_relationships between the local_government and the government-PRI apparatus which are characterized as three types of domination: clientelistic, corporative and bureaucratic. This dissertation_concludes that the proliferation of popular protests at the local_level and their linkages to regional_and_national movements are creating pressure to modify the traditional patterns_of_local politics. This pressure will continue to grow as the municipios modernize. In this sense, local popular_movements that struggle for the ayuntamiento have a real potential to challenge the political_system as it is currently structured."
8957,"The purpose_of_this_dissertation is to achieve a higher level of understanding of the adoption_and_diffusion_process of conservation technology on Iowa farms. The tools used in this discovery_process are a qualitative_analysis of farmers' perceptions of conservation technologies, an analysis of the adoption_and_diffusion model, and the formulation of a local dependency_theory_to_explain the patterns of adoption on Iowa farms. Specifically, this investigation comes to the conclusion that the Iowa farmer is trapped in a dependency situation that is controlled by the government, trans-national corporations, and local capital, a triad known as the triple alliance. The resulting dependency hampers the adoption of technologies that do not benefit the triple alliance. The argument is based on an USDA_funded study of mid-western farmers known as the Management Systems Evaluations Area project, or MSEA. The socio-economic, portion_of_the_study_employed the focus_group_and_case_study methods of investigating farmers' reaction to the conservation technologies of ridge_tillage and permanent vegetative_filter strips. The studies revealed a dependency situation on the farm that was preventing the adoption of the two technologies. As a result, the dependency_theory_of_international_development was reformulated to the local_level_of_abstraction to explain_the_adoption_process in relation to conservation technology adoption. The use of dependency_theory_to_explain_the_adoption_of_conservation_technology overcomes_the_traditional_shortcomings of the widely_accepted adoption model that originates from the modernization_theory of development and the concepts of rational_choice and the free market. The reformulation provides an understanding of the conservation_technology_adoption_process that better fits the current sociopolitical_situation of the Iowa farmers."

Moral panics occur when a perceived_threat to the social_order_emerges with such force, and with such little overt warning, that routine_discourse about right and wrong gives way to a flood of indignation about an extraordinary breach of normal moral boundaries. Suspending normal rules_governing_social control, officials rush to crack down on the newly_discovered menace. This study_examined the role_played by newsworkers in the social_construction of a moral panic. For over three years, the case of alleged_abuse was covered by three newspapers and several television_and_radio stations. Friends and family fiercely proclaimed the innocence of the defendants. Supporters of the alleged victims insisted that the children were telling the truth. In the middle of this maelstrom were the reporters, whose news_accounts were closely_scrutinized by all the parties to the case. The case_study_revealed that the reporters--working in an intensely competitive environment--effectively allowed the prosecution to define the case against the defendants and, more generally, to define child_sexual_abuse as a fundamental threat_to_social order. Specifically, the case_study_revealed the special_role_played by anonymous_sources during moral panics. Anonymity provided official_sources with an opportunity to favor sympathetic reporters, ignore others, and strategically release information likely to support the prosecution. Further, the case_study_revealed the central_role of language in the social_construction of a moral panic. Highly charged words_and_symbols became the linguistic representations of the evil that was threatening the community. And the choices_made by the newsworkers as to how they would describe the alleged acts, often the result of substantial internal conflict within the newsgathering organizations, were a fundamental_means by which the deviant threat was constructed. Finally, the case_study_revealed that, while the reporters were expected to maintain at least an appearance of emotional distance, they faced_the_same_challenge_as_everyone_else_in_a_community seized by moral panic: Confronting a relatively ""new"" threat, they needed_to_understand the threat and cope with their own feelings_of_anger and revulsion. While they struggled to maintain at least a veneer of objectivity, these powerful emotions--felt most intensely when they heard_the_children testify--often led them to construct news_accounts suggesting that the children were telling the truth."
47235,"The management_literature focuses on the value of firm-specific resources for the competitive advantage. It is proposed that the interactions with the vendors internationally promote organizational_learning about the value of newly emergent resources. The learning enhances organizational profitability, and helps upgrade technological capability, through trading of the know-how. Consequently, Japanese_corporations are trying to market their firm-specific services through direct diffusion of investment networks overseas for added technological growth. The proposed_model is summarized below: Globalization [arrow right] Organizational Planning [arrow right] Organizational Programming [arrow right] Organizational Learning [arrow right] Organizational Profitability [arrow right] Organizational Development [arrow right] Technological Capability [arrow right] Technological Investment [arrow right] Technological Trading [arrow right] Technological Servicing [arrow right] Technological Exchange [arrow right] Technological Growth It is hypothesized that, as the Japanese_firms sought to diffuse their investment networks overseas, there was an increasing entropy in their power to program new learning about the creative emerging market options. Further academic_research_is_recommended on the cultural forces, and the system of productive work in Japan, for explaining why the Japanese_firms have not been able to successfully correct the sustained detrimental-effects of investment diffusion. American firms could play a leading_role in diffusing their own learning about the revolutionary turnaround in productivity_growth over the late 1980s and early 1990s to the Japanese firms. The conclusions suggest a need to evaluate the firm-specific resources as essentially dynamic options , which could be operated for substantially_higher_levels of productivity than are being realized empirically. For dynamic modeling of technological growth, there is a need to scientifically quantify the overall growth_potential of the firm-specific resources, as against just the existing profitability . As for the managerial implications, the model highlights that the less productive_resources imply higher cost, and the firms owning such resources could seek to trade them in the market for generating additional revenues and sustaining competitive advantage. Such trading could generate a significant demand for worldwide organizational_learning of how these firm-specific resources are developed, and consequently help the maturing firms owning non-tradable resources generate increasing rents."
42155,"This study_explores_the_nature of Jewish_identity and identification in contemporary_American society. It is anchored theoretically in an analysis of alternative models of the nature of ethnic relations. Traditional models, including the theory of the melting pot, cultural pluralism, and the dominant perspective, assimilation, are discussed_in_Chapter I and found_to_be_inadequate for the depiction and explanation of the Jewish experience. An alternative model, called ethnogenesis, is developed, which emphasizes changes in group life and the creation of new definitions of what it means to be an ethnic group member as well as the partial maintenance of traditional group characteristics and behavior patterns. Chapter_II_explores the American_Jewish_experience in some detail, paying particular attention to the religious_and_ethnic duality of this group's attitudes and behavior. To test_the_applicability of the ethnogenesis model, a research strategy_was_devised which utilized a new survey as well as an existing, larger-scale survey of Jewish_attitudes and behavior. The former survey sampled the beliefs_and_practices of Jews raised and confirmed in a Reform_Jewish congregation in Erie, Pennsylvania. Members of the sample were adults_aged thirty-one to forty-one; as many of those who were confirmed (at age fifteen) in this congregation from 1952 to 1962 were contacted and surveyed by means_of_a_mailed questionnaire. A reform congregation was chosen_in_order_to_maximize_the_likelihood of assimilation and thus provide a severe test of the ethnogenesis model. To supplement data from this small sample, data from the 1970-71 National_Jewish Population Survey, sponsored by the Council_of_Jewish Federations and Welfare Funds, were also employed, and findings from the Erie survey were compared with findings from a comparable age group in the National survey. Chapters IV and V, the data_analysis chapters, examine in detail the shape of contemporary_Jewish ethnicity. Chapter V focuses on Jewish identity, which refers to the subjective or attitudinal dimension of being Jewish--the meaning of being Jewish to the individual Jew. Chapter V focuses on identification, which refers to the behavioral dimension--what people do in their lives to announce to themselves and to others the fact of their Jewishness. Both chapters examine these issues from the standpoint of both the religious and the ethnic component of Jewishness. Chapter_VI attempts to bring together the detailed_analyses of the preceding_chapters and to examine_the_case for the ethnogenesis model. It concludes that ethnogenesis is a superior way of depicting and explaining patterns of contemporary_Jewish life, and is probably a superior general_model for the study of ethnic relations. Data from the Erie and national surveys indicate that new cultural patterns have emerged in this society that define Jewish_identity and identification, and that, accordingly, an accurate_portrayal of Jewish_life cannot be made simply by examining the extent to which traditional group patterns of belief and behavior have persisted. While the shape of Jewish_life has clearly changed, with many traditional_beliefs_and_practices abandoned, Jews continue to identify as Jews, their Jewishness continues to have subjective importance to them, and they continue to act_in_ways that identify them to others as members of a distinct group. Despite the ease and potential for assimilation, Jews persist as a group, losing some ground to attribution and lower_birth rates, but nevertheless preserving linked patterns of belief and action."
49371,"This study_examined the relationships among individual well-being, family_relationship_quality and family_structure (mother's sexual_orientation and mother's relationship status) in dyads from non-traditional families, in which each dyad was composed of a mother and an adolescent or adult child. The study_included 112 mother/child dyads with an additional 29 families who had at least one family member participating. All mothers had legally divorced or ended a significant_relationship with a man in which a child was conceived. In regard to family structure, 75 families had mothers who subsequently were in relationships exclusively_or_primarily with other women, while 66 families had heterosexual mothers. Families were further categorized by mother's relationship status: mothers who were single (never remarried) versus_mothers who had married or partnered again. Results showed some support for the hypothesis that family_relationship_quality is related to mother and child's individual well-being: dyadic affectual_solidarity for mothers and children and dyadic_conflict for mothers. In regard to the family_structure hypothesis, mother's sexual_orientation was not related to quality of the dyad's relationship, mother's well-being or child's well-being. Mother's relationship status_was_significantly_related to mother's well-being."
11095,"This dissertation_investigates the conjunction of periodical publishing, autobiographical expression, and cultural ""democratization"" at the turn_of_the_twentieth_century in America. By examining a range of texts_originally published in leading American periodicals, this study_seeks to appraise the social relevance and literary significance of autobiographical_writing at a time when William_Dean_Howells proclaimed autobiography ""this most democratic province of the republic of letters."" While the democratization of both the form_of_autobiography and the forum of American periodicals opened the way for many who aspired to national publication, this study_contends that such access was circumscribed and shaped by the problematic democracy that characterized American_life and letters at the turn of the century. This dissertation also proposes and applies a critical method that combines the theoretical_questions of periodical studies and autobiography studies. Critical questions regarding authorship, reading, and publishing, mediation and immediacy, and authority_and_authenticity guide this study's examination of autobiographical expression at the turn of the century. Chapter One considers a set of brief autobiographical_texts_originally published in the New York Independent and later collected and reprinted as The Life Stories of Undistinguished Americans: As Told by Themselves (1906). This chapter_argues that, by privileging authenticity of the autobiographical_subject over traditional_notions of authorship, the editors of the Independent contributed to new conceptions of autobiography itself. Chapter Two examines a series of life_stories from the Independent that directly addressed America's ""race problem"" from what W. E. B. Du_Bois called ""the Negro point of view."" Fusing personal and editorial points of view, ""human interest"" and political interests, these stories put autobiography to the service of cultural_critique in unique ways. Finally, Chapter Three investigates the social significance of Native_American_autobiographical expression in American periodicals at the turn of the century. Focusing on Charles Alexander Eastman's ""Recollections of the Wild Life,"" this chapter_contextualizes such narratives of Indian childhood by engaging contemporary_assumptions about Native Americans as a ""child race"" and by examining the popular children's pastime, ""Playing Indian."""
24462,"This dissertation_examines_the_political and educational perspectives regarding English Language Learner (ELL) education. The broad_context is the state_of_Arizona between 2000 and 2004. The specific_context is the community of Rio Verde, a border_town in Arizona. The data_for_this_study_consisted of a document_review and analysis and interviews. The document_review was of public documents. The interviews were with 10 study_participants from the community of Rio_Verde consisting of teachers, administrators, former students, and parents. The document_analysis_revealed two distinct positions regarding the education of ELL students; those in favor of English-only policies_and_practices and those against English-only policies and practices. The study_participants from Rio_Verde focused on beliefs about bilingualism and binationalism, immigration, the local_history of ELL education, systemic inequities, and the role_of_the_teacher in ELL education. Implications from this study that may be used to inform ELL policy and practice included: effective methodologies for ELL_students based on educational research, collaboration in language_policy development, placing value on the local_context and history, discussion, reflection, and research as decision-making, and, teacher_education programs' focus on ELL education."

49795,"Research suggests that non-judgmental, unbiased counseling (that includes an advocacy component) is effective in addressing the psycho-social needs of sexual_minority youths--a population_of_students considered at-risk (Reynolds & Koski, 1994; Savin-Williams, 1994). The ability_to_provide such services is impeded if the clinician has not first come to terms with his or her own feelings_and_attitudes about homosexuality (Pederson, 1988). This study_examined the attitudes and anticipated professional behaviors relevant to sexual_minority youths of 309 pupil_services professionals in the fields of school psychology, school social work, school nursing, and school counseling. Participants from two regions of the US (Florida and New Jersey) responded to a survey comprising a homophobia_measure and a measure of anticipated professional behavior toward sexual_minority youths, and questionnaires collecting demographic information. Results_of_multiple_regression analysis, with the significance level_set at .05, indicated that levels of homophobic bias were positively_correlated with political_conservatism ( r = .52), high_religiosity ( r = .51), and lower education levels ( r = .30) among the participants. Furthermore, a backward_elimination model predicting biased professional behaviors toward sexual_minority youths was significant ( p = .001). Results indicated that those less likely to employ gay affirming professional behaviors were more politically_conservative ( p = .001) than those more likely to do so. Implications of this study_suggest that even among these counseling professionals, personal ideologies and dogmatic belief_systems could potentially impede many of their ability or willingness to advocate in behalf of sexual_minority students. Training efforts, therefore, should assist these professionals in distinguishing between their personal ideologies with regard to sexual_orientation diversity and their professional responsibility to serve the needs of all students."
25314,"HIV/AIDS has been identified as a health_crisis among African-American Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM). Furthermore, due to more effective medical treatments, HIV-positive individuals are healthier and more sexually active, raising new questions regarding HIV-disclosure. This research utilizes grounded_theory to explore_the_role of HIV-related stigma on sexual communication, disclosure strategies, and experiences of HIV-disclosure in a sample_of_twenty HIV+, African-American MSM_recruited from a community-based organization. The study_found that HIV-disclosure strategies are influenced by both direct_and_indirect experiences_of_stigma and decisions to disclose are based on whether a sexual partner can be trusted to keep HIV-status information private. Limited trust decreases the likelihood that HIV-disclosure will occur in casual or anonymous sexual encounters. Therefore, interventions should take into account the role of trust-building as a factor in sexual-risk negotiation and HIV-disclosure practices."
40377,"The interview has been a common_method for gathering information. Despite its ease of administration, the interview can produce considerable measurement error. As artifacts of the interview, specific biases are exhibited when particular question formats are used. If the interview is to be used as a scientific technique, interviewers should be aware of the types of biases produced. Previous survey_research has suggested that individuals_with_mental_retardation are particularly susceptible to giving inaccurate responses depending_on_the_type of question asked. The purpose_of_the_present_investigation_was_to_examine further the types_of_questions which produce_inaccurate responding, and suggest_ways_to_circumvent any bias. In order to study response biases systematically, an experiment was completed that disentangled question content from question format in a factorial_experimental design. Three types of question formats were studied, (a) yes-no, (b) either-or, and (c) multiple-choice. Each question type was presented with or without ""happy"" or ""sad"" faces. Each format was designed to detect an acquiescence, wording order, or position bias, and was repeated across three positively regarded contents (home, specifically named friends, friends in general), and three negatively regarded contents (prison, specifically named physical pain, and physical_pain in general). Based_on_the_interview_responses of 115 midwestern adults_with_mental retardation, four major_findings emerged. First, question formats made_a_huge difference in the responses given by adults_with_mental retardation. The respondents' claims of satisfaction were determined by the way the question was worded, as well as the topic addressed. Second, only 15% of the cohort made no self-contradictions across the three couplets of yes-no questions_designed to detect acquiescence and nay-saying. Third, an echolalia effect was found in 50% of the sample when they responded to either-or and multiple-choice question types. Fourth, the multiple-choice, five-faces picture format yielded the most accurate_responding with the highest response rate; and the either-or format, ""usually satisfied or usually dissatisfied,"" elicited no recency effect, suggesting that these types of questioning may circumvent wording order bias. These findings_have_implications_for_human_service_providers who make_policy_decisions_based on the interview_responses given by their clients.

15849,"The Politics of Whiteness is a regional study of politics, textile labor, and racial_ideology in Rome and Floyd County, Georgia from the 1930s to the 1960s. Based on oral histories, manuscript_collections of Georgia political leaders, voter_registration records, precinct returns, state_and_federal labor agency records, and union archives, it examines_the_ways that white racial_ideology_shaped_the_history of Southern workers, unions, politics, and labor policy. Because race determined not only rights_of_citizenship but access to employment, white racial_identity was a central_aspect of the Southern working-class experience. Especially among textile workers, an exclusively_white workforce until the 1960s, race shaped_ideas about class, tempered adversarial relationships between millhands and managers, and informed workers' choices in regard to politics and unions. While most Southern_textile_labor histories focus on unions, this dissertation_focuses on race and politics, examining the impact of working-class whiteness on managerial paternalism, the 1934 General Textile Strike, southern opposition to federal_antidiscrimination policy during the New Deal_and_World_War_II and southern resistance to civil rights. It examines the racial basis of New South economic boosterism and paternalism, and analyzes the sources of white working-class support for Governor Eugene Talmadge. In a region where politics is ordinarily assumed to be an elite affair, the dissertation_reveals a surprising level of white working-class political_influence and activism. The dissertation also emphasizes the local impact_of_national_politics and policy, analyzing community resistance to federal_antidiscrimination initiatives during World_War II, and showing how local_leaders coopted federal_labor_policy and installed a ""labor stabilization plan"" to preserve segregation and the low-wage, sex-typed, white workforce. It also examines working-class antiunionism, local CIO political actions, and finally the convergence of white working-class and elite_political_views regarding Governor Herman Talmadge. In conclusion, the dissertation_challenges notions about the alleged distinctiveness of southern workers, and provides new insight into the resilience of the South's one-party system, the fervency of white_resistance to Civil Rights, and the failure of federal_antidiscrimination policy at mid-century."
33560,"This study_is_a_qualitative_analysis of the impact_of_gender on sexual decision making. Using in-depth interviews with 83 heterosexual young people, three styles of negotiating sexual_encounters are identified, each based on the degree of agency the individual adopts within the negotiation--agentic, non-agentic and transitional. The way gender_influences the individual's adoption of a specific negotiation style is then examined. At the most basic level, there is a gendered skew within both the agentic and non-agentic styles. The young_men in this study were twice as likely as the women to negotiate with an agentic style while the young_women were more likely to exhibit non-agentic behavior than the men were. While this finding is addressed, particular attention_is_paid to the fact that these young_people did not fall into two homogeneously gendered groups. Both women_and_men significantly represented each of the three styles. Thus, this study_finds that gender does not determine sexual_agency in a straightforward or dichotomous manner. Chodorow's (1995) concept of a ""personal sense of gender"" is used to theoretically explore_the_diversity within gender evidenced in this data. In the accounts shared by these subjects, we see the process by which an individual creates his or her own personal_sense of gender through (conscious and unconscious) emotional_attachment to and investment in some gender images and not others. Links are then delineated between the individual's personal_sense of gender and the degree of agency they demonstrate in negotiating sexual encounters. The study_found those subjects expressing the strongest disappointment about their sexual experiences to be the least agentic in negotiating for what they want. It is mostly within the accounts of the non-agentic and transitional subjects (the majority of which are women) that we hear stories of sexual regret. However, unlike the non-agentic subjects, within the transitional group, this regret is often a catalyst for change. In such cases, the experience_of_regret is a powerful factor that helps them to adopt a more agentic style of negotiating future sexual encounters."

This study_empirically_tested the validity of each model by testing their respective underlying assumptions. Eighty mother-daughter pairs (40 African-American and 40 Caucasian) participated in this study. The extended Marcia status interview scale was used to assess identity resolution. Questionnaire data was used to assess_maternal generativity, psychosocial competence, identification and perception of maternal behavior. The Developmental Congruence model, of the three models, provides the best explanation_of_the_underlying process. Maternal generativity, as predicted, was positively_related_to_identity resolution.

42832,"The purpose_of_this_study_was_to_analyze connections between specific literary movements in relation to selected sociopolitical_movements and leaders of the black Diaspora. The study_investigated the importance of unfaltering leadership in the emergence and transnational propagation of literary movements which influenced the progression_and_continuity of sociopolitical movements. The 19 th -20 th century_literary_and_sociopolitical_movements include Pan-Africanism , Garveyism , Indig&eacute;nisme , Harlem_Renaissance , and N&eacute;gritude . Leaders associated with these movements are Edward Blyden, Martin Delany, W. E. B. Du Bois, Zora_Neale Hurston, Marcus Garvey, Amy Jacques-Garvey, Jean Price-Mars, Aim&eacute; C&eacute;saire, Jane and Paulette Nardal, Kwame Nkrumah, and Malcolm X. The analysis of the writings of these leaders and selected forerunners (e.g., Toussaint Louverture and Frederick Douglass) revealed connective linkages between literary_and_sociopolitical movements. Common themes include struggles for independence, appropriate educational_philosophy to foster black progress, necessity of black-controlled businesses, preservation of African heritage, articulation and implementation of black power, and the role of black_women activists. Chronologically, Black Nationalism--in all its forms, i.e., both avant_la_lettre and nominal--gave birth to Pan-Africanism and Garveyism , Indig&eacute;nisme and Harlem_Renaissance , and N&eacute;gritude . In turn, these movements contributed to evolving definitions and functions of Black Nationalism. A key element if not the foundational component of Black Nationalism, throughout these literary_and_sociopolitical movements, was the advocacy for relevant education within the black Diaspora. The study's significance is its contribution to broadening an understanding of the connections between movements of the black Diaspora. Greater emphasis on literary, sociopolitical relations between blacks in Africa, the Americas, and Europe, will enable scholars to better understand and contextualize the ideological exchanges and sociocultural_influences that play a paramount_role in advancing intellectual_evolution and political processes of the black world. Future_research_should_continue to dismantle geographical and linguistic_barriers by situating movements throughout the Diaspora in relational context and placing leaders of such movements in direct or indirect dialogue."
15396,"During the recession_of_the_early 1980s, the United_States experienced a massive industrial downturn. More than 3 million blue-collar jobs permanently vanished from the economic landscape, altering the structure and availability of once-viable career paths. Therefore, the goal_of_this_project was to learn about the experiences of the sons_and_daughters of blue-collar workers who cannot follow in their parents' footsteps, but instead must transition into careers in a postindustrial economy. Guided by life course theory, I interviewed 62 people---sons, daughters, fathers, and mothers---to determine how family-based communication about work_and_career both helped and hindered one cohort of ""blue-collar kids"" in their career transitions. The research consisted of two phases, an archival phase and an interview phase. The archival_research traced events of the recession (1979-1982), particularly as they related to industrial downturn in a small Michigan mining community. The interview-based research_phase delved into the life courses of a cohort_of_individuals who came of age during that particular period of economic downturn. These individuals' (and their parents') work histories, family messages about work and career, and career and class identities, reveal several important_insights into postindustrial career transitions. First, the ""kids""' and parents' constructions of periods of economic_downturn serve several notable purposes, including destigmatizing the experience of job loss, offering a viable_model of lifetime employability, and backgrounding_the_politics_of_economic downturns. Second, family-based messages about work_and_career do not occur in straightforward, unambiguous memorable messages. Instead, communication about these issues---and ultimately communication about social_class_mobility and reproduction---emerges and comes to be understood through relational dialectics. Third, this cohort simultaneously must reconcile_competing_tensions between two macrolevel discourses that dictate, to an extent, how careers should unfold. On one hand, blue-collar kids are driven by the social_mobility mandates of the American_Dream and, on the other hand, are committed_to_upholding the values-based obligations of the Working Class Promise. The findings_contribute_to_the_literature_on_organizational socialization, family communication, and career identities. The findings also are suggestive of several interventions for communities facing deindustrialization."
25526,"This study examines the relationship_between_marital_conflict and contradictions of relating. Twenty-five couples, married at least one year, completed_interviews and questionnaire surveys designed_to_determine if six contradictions of relating (autonomy/connection, predictability/novelty, openness/closedness, third-party openness/closedness, integration/separation, conventionality/uniqueness) are central to, or important in conflict episodes. The three research_questions center around the proportion of conflicts_involving contradictions of relating, the extent to which partners embrace opposite_poles of the six contradictions, and whether repeating conflicts are more likely than non-repeating conflicts to involve contradictions of relating. The findings from this study demonstrate that contradictions of relating are important to conflict processes. First, contradictions of relating were reported in 92.8% of all conflict_episodes identified by marital couples. Two themes_emerged in over 50% of all conflicts for this sample, they are autonomy/connection and openness/closedness. Second, in at least 20% of all cases marital_partners_perceived that they were in antagonistic opposition with their partner with regard to the six contradictions of relating. Differences between men_and_women_were_found with regard to these dialectical oppositions. Women were generally more concerned_with_issues of connection, predictability, openness, and conventionality, while men were generally more concerned_with_issues of autonomy, novelty, closedness, and uniqueness. Third, minor_differences between repeating and non-repeating conflicts were found with regard to conflict_issues between men and women. Conflict issues that tend to be repeating conflicts for this population of respondents included: personal issue/criticism, household chores, finances, communication, sex, and crisis events. Differences between men_and_women for repeating and non-repeating conflicts tended to involve three internal_contradictions for repeating conflicts. That is, women generally reported_higher frequencies than men for internal themes, while men_reported_higher frequencies for two external themes (integration/separation and conventionality/uniqueness). These findings indicate that the study of marital_conflict and contradictions of relating is a viable and important_area for continued research."
41852,"Juxtaposing Charleston, South Carolina, women of all colors, social_and_economic groups starkly_reveals women and gender as central to the expression and transmission of power in urban slave society. This study_documents how women of African_and_European_descent derived their identities from the ways in which their lives entwined in daily comparison and contention. Slave society enmeshed them inextricably yet separated them relentlessly in a complex braid that could weave neither so loosely that it fell apart, nor so tightly that the distinctive strands mingled inappropriately. Aggressive gender_construction was central to this enterprise, for differentiating types of women was pivotal to patriarchy and paternalism, twin_pillars of slavery. Thus, a woman also gained her sense of self and learned her social_roles from men's disparate_treatment of women; both men_and_women plaited women's lives. Stepping into multiple arenas from bed chambers to courtrooms, I elaborate slave society's volatile, capricious alliances among and between women and men, poor and rich, color and white, slave and free. I refute facile notions_of_race or gender solidarity. Notwithstanding urban propinquity and the intimacy of women's connections, mistresses and slaves did not move beyond deeply_ambivalent relationships into a collective women's culture. The same holds true of slaveholding ladies and white laboring women. Common female experiences knit women together; slavery's distinctions of color, bondage, and wealth separated them, fomenting intimate estrangement. There were few easy alliances. The subjects considered herein--the impact of the Revolution upon women; political uses of gender, race, and class; construction of diametric sub-cultures--have been examined in a variety of contexts. But few have analyzed how urban women's lives converged in mutual definition and the centrality of this dynamic in legitimating authority in the southern city. It in impossible fully to understand southern women, slavery, or urban_society without studying diverse_women in juxtaposition."
37780,"During the late 1980s, fiscal pressures and lack of federal leadership prompted many states to undertake health_care_reform initiatives. As purchasers, regulators, and providers of health_care services, the states are well positioned to experiment with health_care_system change. Within constraints set by federal law, state health_care_reform_policies vary considerably in their approaches to containing health_care costs, expanding access, reorganizing and rationalizing the health_care system. This research_seeks_to_identify determinants of cross-state variations in eleven state-level health_care_reform policies. Three state theory variants frame the analysis.Overall, state theory is concerned with the role_of_government in allocating resources_among_competing social groups. Structural state theory_emphasizes the impact of the economic_dominance of particular business sectors and the presence of fiscal_crisis on policy. Class dominance state theory_suggests the importance of the relative unity of organized_interests and the mobilization_strategies they use to influence_policy outcomes. State-centered state theory acknowledges the effect of government organizational_capacity and policy history Donna Clarice Bird--University of Connecticut, 2001 on policy formation. Explanations from three other perspectives related to state-centered state theory--political party dominance, state political culture, and innovation diffusion--are also included. Determinants derived from all of these perspectives may affect state health_care_reform policies, although their degree_of_influence is contingent on historical and local circumstances, as well as the particular policy. The analytic approach is quantitative, using data for all 50 states and relying on ordinary_least_squares and ordered_logistic_regression build models. The independent_variables measure economic dominance, state_fiscal crisis, interest group unity and mobilization, government organizational capacity, health_policy history, political party dominance, state_political_culture and innovation diffusion. The dependent_variables are indices based on the ultimate status of health_care_reform_policies proposed, adopted or implemented by individual states during the period 1988-1994. Policies included in this analysis are: physician fee regulation, Medicaid_managed care, health_insurance premium caps, community rating, government_subsidized insurance, employer and individual mandates, antitrust immunity, limits on physician self-referrals, standardized electronic claims processing and comprehensive_health_care data_collection and analysis."
20741,"This study_examined_the_relationship of the degree of social_support available to families_with_handicapped_preschool_children to the nature of maternal interactions with the child. Also examined was the relationship of role sharing_between_a_husband_and_wife to the nature of maternal interactions with handicapped_preschool children. Forty-one rural_North_Carolina families were randomly_selected_from_a_list of active participants in a community-based infant_stimulation program for preschool children. The 41 mothers_were_interviewed using the Psychosocial Kinship Inventory and the Parent Role Scale. Sessions with 34 of the 41 mothers and their children_were_videotaped during a 15-minute play session. Findings indicated there were no statistical_differences_in_selected_demographic_characteristics of mothers who engaged in more positive interactions with their handicapped_child when compared_to_mothers who engaged in less positive interactions with their handicapped_child during the 15-minute play session. No differences_were_found in the degree of social_support available to mothers who engaged in less positive interactions with their handicapped child. Also, no differences_were_found in the role sharing_between_a_husband_and_wife with mothers who engaged in more positive interactions with their handicapped_child_and_mothers who engaged in less positive interactions. The results_of_this_study indicate that families_with_handicapped_children have fewer_social_supports than do families_with_children not so handicapped. It can be speculated that if families have social_support_networks too small to provide_adequate support, these networks are also too small to have impact on mother-child interactions. Findings indicated that the 41 mothers performed the majority of family roles. The mothers also expressed_satisfaction with their family role division, and reported that they interact positively with their handicapped children."
41760,"Concerns over racial_identity have been at the center of public dialogues concerning transracial_adoption since it first emerged as a controversial issue in the early 1970s. The central_question regarding the appropriateness of this social practice is whether or not White parents are capable of teaching their children African_American_culture and history, and enculturating them with the survival_skills necessary for Blacks to survive in the racially_stratified United States. This dissertation is about the social_construction of identity, and the connections among identity, race, and public policy. This interdisciplinary ethnography_explores_the_social_construction of transracial adoptees' identities in cultural, political, and historical contexts. I consider public_and_private narratives linking identity, kinship, culture, social institutions, and the political_economy in a range of cultural sites including public policy, political discourse, news coverage, popular culture, the perspectives of social_workers in the field of adoption, and the life histories of adult transracial adoptees. Chapter One provides an overview of the issue, including discussion of recent changes in adoption and social_welfare policy, contemporary_racial politics, and how the lives of transracial_adoptees have been shaped by the policies of the U.S. child_welfare system. I detail the theories and methods I have drawn on in this narrative analysis, including_ethnographic methods, critical_race theory, feminist theory, cultural studies, and discourse analysis. In Chapter Two, I provide a history of transracial_adoption in the post_World_War_II United States, consider the available research on transracial adoption, and discuss the ethnographic method I employ in this study. Chapter Three focuses on the life histories of twenty-one adult transracial_adoptees that emerged in ethnographic_interviews I conducted. In Chapter Four, I consider recent public_discourse concerning adoption and welfare reform, as well as ethnographic_interviews_with_social_workers in public_and_private adoption agencies. In the final_chapter I discuss the ""discursive map"" that emerged in this study, and the ways in which these narrative_patterns of race and identity, family and culture, gender and work, citizenship and nation speak beyond the lives of adoptees and their families."

30500,"Research has shown that the process_of_divorce is extremely stressful for children, with children_of_divorce found to be more anxious, depressed, worried, aggressive, and demonstrating more learning_problems than children_from_intact families. Gender, age, and intrafamilial factors have been noted as important moderators for positive adjustment. Gender role has been proposed as another potentially_important_moderator as it impacts on self-esteem and identity. A sample of 139 second and third grade_children was evaluated, including 56 children_of_divorce and 83 children from an intact family comparison group. The Children's Personal Attribute Questionnaire was administered to examine_gender_role distribution. Other questionnaires, including the Children's Divorce Adjustment Scale, the Child_Depression Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety_Inventory for Children, and the Children's Beliefs_About_Parental_Divorce Scale, were also used to assess adjustment. In addition, parents_and_teachers_completed adjustment_measures of the children. Previous research was confirmed which indicated better adjustment for children_from_intact families. Boys showed more acting out behavior, while girls_showed more task-oriented behavior. Masculine attributes corresponded to less worry and anxiety. Feminine attributes corresponded with a better ability_to_cope with problems. Children high_on_both_masculine_and_feminine_attributes (measured on the CPAQ) were found to worry less and to better cope with problems. Findings from parent and teacher measures were similar, with teachers being somewhat more traditional and stereotypical. Other variables such as the amount_of_time since the divorce and type of contact with the non-custodial parent were seen to impact on the masculine_and_feminine_attributes of the children. Various areas of clinical_intervention_and_future_research_were_suggested in terms of working with children, parents and teachers. It was also suggested that future_work might focus on such qualities as instrumentality and expressivity, rather than ""masculinity"" or ""femininity."""
36734,"The purpose_of_this_study is to examine how discrimination affects the ethnic_identity of Mexican Americans. Social identity of Mexican Americans is posited to take four manifestations, with these manifestations influenced by subjective (person) variables and objective (situation) variables criteria. The bases of these manifestations emerge from an interaction of the dimensions of individualism-collectivism and cultural assimilation--autonomy. The ethnic_identity that is hypothesized to be most affected by discrimination is the one composed_of_Mexican Americans who are collectivistic and autonomous, for this is the manifestation where ethnic_identity is most salient and where cultural_maintenance is highest. The data for the analysis comes from the National_Chicano_Survey (1979), a representative_sample of people_of_Mexican_descent_living_in_the_United States. The results supported the hypothesis--that discrimination has a significant_effect on the ethnic_identity and self-esteem of the hypothesized group of Mexican Americans. Also, adding to the importance of the results was the fact that the effects_of_mediating_variables of discrimination (e.g., education, English ability, income, etc.) were statistically controlled. Finally, the findings_are_discussed_in_terms of the potential for collective_action among Mexican Americans and implications of the findings for the increased_incidence of discrimination today."
15481,"This work is an exploration of the relationship between computer_simulation in science and the experience_of_living_in_a_world seen through the computer model. If computer_modeling_and_simulation are increasingly used to see society as a complex system how does seeing society in this way affect how we experience and engage with the world around us? In what ways do computer models affect how one thinks about their agency in the world? To explore the relationships between computation and human reflexivity I conducted a six-year participant_observation_study_of_the_emerging_field_of_computational_social_science where social_scientists and computer_scientists are using a modeling paradigm_called ""agent-based computer modeling and simulation"" (ABM) to create a new area of social science. During the study I worked for four years as a full member in a modeling group at a private research institution, attended conferences_and_workshops in computational social science, coauthored_papers in the area, designed dozens of social models using ABM platforms developed within the community, and interviewed researchers throughout the community. The findings here indicate that reflexive mechanisms in agent-based modeling have the capability of quickly scaling or integrating together broader_issues_of_cultural and ecological_change to specific individual contexts. This is done through what I refer to as an embodied reflexive practice, which is the use of the practitioner's body and identity to make_sense of, explore, and update models of human_agency in computer simulations. An embodied reflexive practice seeks_to_create cultural_understanding out of and through technical depth and use culture and identity as a way of learning from models that are, by their nature, unrealistic and imperfect representations of the world. Such translations occur through the capability of computers to put massive_numbers of individual models of human_agents on the loose in a virtual_world in order_to_make_meaning in the real world. The hope is that an embodied reflexive practice will make exploring, testing, validating, and shaping system models a meaningful way of interacting and being in the world and strengthen human_relationships to the natural world."
9089,"The dependency discourse has become a prominent_concern in discussions of welfare policies in the United States. To address the cultural fear of dependence on welfare, the 1996 welfare_reform greatly emphasized work_and_marriage promotion. Poor single_mothers_on_welfare were mandated to move into the workforce under a cultural belief held by the Administration that work leads to independence. Feminists suggest that independence upheld by welfare_reform is discussed from a middle-class, patriarchal perspective with an emphasis on financial self-sufficiency, which largely overlooks issues_of_gender_and_social_class intertwined with poverty. Additionally, marriage promotion is deemed by feminists to discourage poor_single_mothers_on_welfare from pursuing independence. Moreover, voices_of_single_mothers have been marginalized from discussions of in/dependence in the context of welfare. This qualitative study, informed by feminist_standpoint theory, aimed to give_voice to single_mothers_on_welfare with a focus on redefining independence generating from their experiences and struggles with motherhood, marriage/relationship, and welfare_policy through multiple in-depth interviews. The research_participants indicated that commitment to and responsibility for the children's best interests enabled them to stay strong in tough circumstances, and make_choices within an environment where resources were limited. Welfare was seen by the participants as one resource to help them on the path toward independence. They articulated two dimensions of independence---financial and psychological---and viewed financial_independence as a path to achieve psychological independence. Marriage was not considered by the mothers until they achieved both financial and psychological independence. Marriage promotion was strongly criticized by the participants because it left poor_single_mothers in a dependency state from welfare to men. Access to education was suggested to taken the place of marriage promotion by the research participants. Findings challenge_the_dominant_discourse of dependency and have implications for professionals who work with mothers who receive welfare."
35643,"This dissertation_examines_the_historical problem of community among the Dutch dairy_farmers of twentieth_century_Southern California. Different kinds of networks among first and second generation Dutch_immigrants are studied for their contributions to Dutch assimilation and economic success. Instead of defining community as a group of people_living within a specific_geographic_area and bound together in a common social enterprise, Barry Wellman's model of community as specialized supportive networks is employed. Wellman's model does not require geographic proximity, although this is not excluded. The network_paradigm explains how a small_group of immigrants, who lacked the population for an immigrant market, successfully assimilated and eventually dominated an industry. This study_finds that the Dutch_immigrants_in_Southern_California formed separate religious, economic, civic, and social_networks that allowed them to assimilate while retaining a secondary ethnic identity. Evidence includes Dutch governmental records, newspapers, church records, Dutch immigrant letters, U.S. census records, and oral interviews. They also brought from the Netherlands modern_dairy farming techniques which they applied to the Southern_California_dairy industry. The combination of their willingness_to_join non-ethnic economic networks and their knowledge of modern_dairy farming explain their economic success."
39176,"The goal_of_the_present_study was to take a grounded_theory_approach in examining the ethnic_identity_development and definitions_of_success among African_American men. It was hoped that a clearer_vision of how African_American_men define_success and the content of African_American men's ethnic_identity would be revealed. An ecological developmental_perspective was used to achieve these goals. A sample of nine men_completed ethnic_identity and racism questionnaires and then participated in extensive semi-structured interviews. Two types of ethnic identities emerged from the study, ethnic_solidarity and multiethnic solidarity. Both types involved a strong pride in the African_American community, but the ethnic_solidarity group placed the livelihood of that community over the livelihood of society as a whole. The multiethnic solidarity group, meanwhile, accepted all groups, regardless of ethnicity, and did not place the survival of one group over another. Success appeared_to_coincide with ethnic_identity type, with individualistic goals coinciding with multiethinic solidarity and more communalistic goals coinciding with ethnic solidarity. An ecological_model was formed from the data, which took into account how the various layers of society can influence_ethnic_identity_development and how a person defines success."
4728,"This work_examines forms_of_social_membership and exclusion in Japan's largest financial service firms. My findings are based on interviews, ethnographic observation, and survey_data with Japanese managers, regular employees, and foreign white-collar co-workers. The study is distinguished_from_earlier works on foreigners in the corporation in that it draws from major social theories on identity_construction (namely nation, race, and ethnicity) to explore the social_and_cultural_consequences of melding of Japanese and foreign employees into an organization. In Chapter Two I show how notions_of_Japanese_uniqueness structure a nationalization of division_of_labor in the firm based on management perceptions of the abilities and contributions of foreign employees. Chapter Three is a critique of nation and nationalism. I examine the theoretical_and_practical_implications of nation, race, and ethnicity and argue that the ideal of a collective national_identity in Japan is based on modern-day notions of a 'Japanese race.' I problematize the concept of race in Japan to critique nation, race, and ethnicity as malleable (at times competing and other times eliding) theoretical_and_practical constructs of identity_formation that inform a Japanese sense of self. I show that race and ethnicity cannot be treated as tangential aspects_of_Japanese social_consciousness that can be neatly dissected and separated from Japanese ideas about nation. Yet, scholars_of_Japanese organizations have not explored the concepts and their effects on organizational_management and employee_relations in the firm. In Chapter Four I contrast public_concern over growing numbers of blue-collar migrant laborers with overwhelmingly_positive_support for the increasing number of white-collar foreigners in Japanese companies. Chapter Five shows how the 'firm as family' metaphor strengthens Japanese employees' commitment for inclusion in the national community. The final_chapter_considers larger socio-political, economic, and cultural effects of foreign professionals in the firm and Japanese society."
33402,"Using interviews with 100 people and field observations, I explore_the_relationship between experiences with offensive public_speech and attitudes toward legal intervention regarding such speech. This dissertation_focuses primarily-on gender-based sexual_harassment between strangers in public_places but uses aggressive begging and racist hate_speech as comparisons. Many people, especially white_women and people of color, are significantly_affected by offensive public_speech in their everyday lives. While there is near consensus that law should not be used to regulate such speech, the reasons vary by social group. I find four main reasons for the opposition to offensive public_speech that correlate with social group. White men disfavor the legal_regulation of speech due_to_concerns about the First Amendment. African-American men cite a general_distrust of authority for their opposition to the legal_regulation of racist speech. Women of all races do not favor laws that prohibit offensive public_speech out of a sense of autonomy; they prefer to handle the situation themselves. Finally, African-American women and many white_women say that laws dealing with offensive public_speech would ultimately fail because it is impractical to attempt to regulate this pervasive activity. The research_demonstrates that legal_consciousness is a product of lay conceptions of legal doctrine, experience with law, and hierarchies of race, gender, and class."
46151,"This dissertation_studies different social_aspects of terrorists and terrorist_organizations in an effort to better deal with terrorism, especially in the long run. The researcher, who also worked as a Police Captain at Turkish_National_Police Anti-Terrorism Department, seeks solutions to today's global_problem by studying both literature and a Delphi examination of a survey of 1070 imprisoned terrorists. The research_questions include questions such as ""What are the reasons behind terrorism?"" , ""Why does terrorism occur?"" , ""What ideologies provide the framework for terrorist violence? , ""Why do some individuals become terrorists and others do not?"" and ""Under what conditions will terrorists end their violence?"" The results of the study_presents the complexity of the terrorism problem as a social experience and impossibility of a single solution or remedy for the global_problem of terrorism. The researcher through his examination of the findings of the data, presented that terrorism is a social_phenomenon with criminal consequences that needs to be dealt by means of two dimensional approaches. The first is the social dimension of terrorism and the second is the criminal dimension of terrorism. Based on this, the researcher constructed a conceptual_model which addresses both of these dimensions under the titles of long-term solutions and short-term solutions. The long-term solutions deal with the social_aspects of terrorism under the title of Proactive Approach to Terrorism and the short-term solutions deal with the criminal aspects of terrorism under the title of The Immediate Fight against Terrorism . The researcher constructed this model because there seems to be a tendency of not asking the question of ""Why does terrorism occur?"" Instead, the focus is usually on dealing with the consequences of terrorism and future terrorist threats. While it is essential that the governments need to provide the finest security measures for their societies, at the same time they need to address the reasons behind terrorism. This research, from stated perspective, offered a conceptual_model to address both aspects of terrorism for a more complete fight against today's most painful problem."
29919,"Using the 1825-1830 censuses for Louisiana and East_Texas as points of reference, this dissertation_shows some outcomes of the transmission of ideas about slave_ownership over time and space. The focus falls on Germans and Franco-Germans. This work_shows the transmission of ideas about owning slaves over time by covering the period from 1719 to 1830. It shows the transference and adaptation of ideas over space by discussing the backgrounds of Germans and Franco-Germans in 1830 Louisiana and East_Texas who had roots in Europe, Acadia, St. Domingue, and the northern_and_southern_United States. Though focusing on the diversity of German populations at different times and from myriad places, the dissertation_makes comparisons and contrasts with the experiences of other major groups: French, Spanish, British. When added to standard social, economic, legal, and geographic factors, the new details reveal the wide panorama of slavery in the West_Gulf South. Also, we may see how the West_Gulf South's people gradually became enmeshed within the web of southern social_and_economic relations, 1719 to 1830. In the main, this work finds that ethnic backgrounds and experiences played a role_in_shaping specific_patterns of slave_ownership along with Louisiana and East Texas' legal_and_economic histories. When giving new details about slave ownership, 1719-1830, this study makes major_points not only for scholars of ethnicity and slavery but also for historians_of_women and gender. It is unique in that it covers native- as well as foreign-born people. Unlike former studies, it takes into account the change of German-American identities over time. Master/slave work relations reflect such a change. Given the community property law for Louisiana and East Texas, it discusses the ownership_of_slaves by women as well as men. The latter approach differs with current studies of the West_Gulf_South that do not recognize the ramifications of such a law."
41114,"This study_investigated the adjustment of the family (parents) of the handicapped child, how this was affected by the child's ""graduating"" from high school, and how the availability_of_social_and_professional_support influenced this adjustment. Because it was felt that adjustment might be influenced by the severity of the disorder, the study also examined how adjustment varied as a function of the severity of 2 aspects of the handicap: functional and behavioral/cognitive. A sample of 94 mothers (60 of whom were married) were questioned regarding their attitudes toward their child, their marital satisfaction, their mental health, and their family relationships. Thirty-two fathers answered questions about their mental_health and marital satisfaction. Data_were_analyzed_using_a_series_of_multiple regressions and MONOVAs within three designs: a crosssectional camparison, a retrospective analysis, and a longitudinal_analysis comparing results before and after graduation. Results indicated that severity of the handicap along the behavioral dimension but not the functional dimension affected mother's adjustment. Increased maternal_social_support_was_related to better family_relations while increased professional_support was related to improved parental_marital_satisfaction_and_family communicativeness. There was no evidence that the child's graduation affected family adjustment. There was some evidence that professional_support and graduation interacted to influence maternal attitude toward the child, although further research_is_needed_to_clarify this finding."
31301,"This study_sought_to_determine which of two forms of group_parent_training was most effective for parents_of_children having problems with aggressive or noncompliant behavior. The 56 parents, recruited from the community, were randomly_assigned to one of three experimental conditions: an 8 week_group_training in behavioral skills, an 8 week_group_training in problem solving, or a waiting_list_control group. The training_groups_were_compared to each other and to the control_group prior to training, immediately after the training, and three months following the end of the training. Outcome was assessed through the Revised_Behavior_Problem Checklist, the Social Problem_Solving_Inventory and via a role play test of parenting skills. In addition, consumer_satisfaction and group process data were collected. The results indicated that there were statistically_significant_differences_between_the_two_experimental_conditions and the control_condition in parent's perceptions_of_child behavior. Specifically, trained parents regarded their children's behavior as less deviant when compared to control parents. Individualized measures of change, using goal_attainment scaling, demonstrated that most trained_subjects_made_progress toward their goals. In addition, several subjects from both training_conditions achieved clinically_significant changes. Group process measures showed that parents in the problem_solving_groups completed significantly less homework and had significantly_worse attendance when compared to parents in the operant skills_training groups. This study provides support for the use of either problem_solving or operant skills_group_training with parents experiencing_problems with their children. However, the improved parental perception of child_behavior_problems over time suggests that subjects may come to social_workers when they are at a crisis point and that to some extent, time alone resolves the problem. The counter-intuitive finding regarding attendance_and_participation in the problem_solving_groups may mean that problem_solving is an easy skill to teach and learn."

The least amount_of_knowledge was reported in regards to the ethnocultural issues_related to early childbearing, and culturally competent service delivery. Formal and informal educational variables predict social_workers knowledge, with experience being named as the best preparation source.

20396,"Research has demonstrated that a significant_number of youths who have been psychiatrically hospitalized for making a suicide attempt report recurrent suicidal_symptoms or re-attempt during longitudinal follow-up. Disturbed family_functioning and negative global perceptions_of_family_relationships represent a category of risk_factors that has been associated with youth suicidality. However, the degree to which parent-child relational dimensions predict_relapse in the aftermath of adolescents' suicide_attempts has not been determined. This prospective_study_examined_the_extent to which relapse following adolescents' suicide_attempts was linked to the perceived parent-child relationship. Subjects_included 88 adolescents who were psychiatrically hospitalized following a serious suicide attempt, and their primary caretakers (80 mothers, 48 fathers). Interviews conducted shortly after the teens' suicide attempts, and at 6 and 12 months posthospitalization, assessed teens' and parents' perceptions of the parent-child relationship and multiple indices of teens' adjustment (e.g., suicidal ideation, hopelessness, psychopathology, and re-attempts). Analyses indicated that at the group-level, ratings of the parent-child relationship remained relatively stable across the follow-up period, while significant_improvement was observed in teens' adjustment. Fifteen (17.1%) adolescents_reported having made_an_attempt at some point during the follow-up period, with the first 100 days posthospitalization being the Period of highest risk. Teens' ratings of greater conflict_with_fathers_and_paternal harshness, Paternal physical abuse, and diagnosis or higher_symptom_levels_of_mood and disruptive_disorders were the strongest predictors_of_recurrent attempts. Relapse in the form of increasing levels_of_suicidal_ideation or hopelessness was associated with ratings of greater unresolved_conflict and less closeness in the parent-child relationship. At 12 months posthospitalization, the number of mood, disruptive, and substance-related disorders, and presence of an anxiety disorder (GAD), were associated with concurrent or previous measures of the perceived parent-child relationship, especially parental harshness, conflict, and lack of closeness. Generally, the results supported the notion that adolescents' adjustment in the year following a suicide attempt is affected by the quality of the perceived parent-child relationship.

24046,"The major theme of this study is to demonstrate_the_importance_of_including the underemployed in assessments of ethnic stratification. Particularly, it is argued that this approach presents a more balanced evaluation of the degree of labor_force integration of the Mexican_origin population. Empirically, the prevalence of underemployment among Mexican_origin and whites workers for the 1976-1987 period is analyzed. During this 12-year span, the level of underemployment for Mexican_workers increased from 32 percent to 42 percent, while the white level fluctuated around 21 percent. Models to determine the causes of underemployment were estimated_using_logistic regression. The models evaluate_the_relative_importance_of_human_capital_variables (e.g., age and schooling) and structural variables (e.g., occupation and industrial_sector location) as determinants of underemployment. Results indicate that young, poorly educated Mexican_origin workers_are_more_vulnerable to underemployment than their white counterparts; that Mexicans incumbents in service and low-skill, blue-collar occupations are more susceptible to underemployment than whites in the same occupations; and that the risk of underemployment is greater for Mexicans than their white_counterparts located in the periphery and trade sectors. It was also found that nativity_status has no statistical effect on the propensity for underemployment. But Mexicans with limited_English_proficiency were more likely to be underemployed than their more English proficient peers. To gauge the effect of labor_underutilization on ethnic inequality, the Mexican-white earnings differential is analyzed controlling for employment instability. Results show that employment instability exerts a heavy cost: Mexican_men who experience employment instability earn 37 percent less than their adequately employed counterparts. Last, the underemployed should be included in ethnic_stratification studies focusing on labor_market_outcomes because their exclusion provides a more conservative assessment of inequality. Data for the analyses come from the Current_Population_Survey and the 1976 Survey_of_Income and Education."
30952,"Empathy is a core component of human_relationships and a cornerstone of effective interpersonal skills. Low levels_of_empathy are associated with negative_outcomes while high_empathy contributes to prosocial behaviors. A large_body_of_literature_exists on empathy but as yet there is no comprehensive_review or meta-analysis of empathy_training_programs with client populations. This study is a meta-analysis that includes 24 studies of empathy_training_programs for client populations. The findings_suggest that empathy_training_programs are effective_in_increasing empathy with an overall large_effect_size of g = 0.911. Moderator_analyses_were_conducted on study design variables, program characteristics, and client variables. Moderator analyses_suggest that empathy_training is effective across a variety of client populations and training modalities. One significant_moderator effect related to the way empathy is measured; studies using self-report outcomes show moderate gains in empathy ( g = 0.386) while studies using observer-report outcomes show_large_gains ( g = 1.488). Because of this large difference, the studies were divided by measurement type. Once the studies were divided by outcome type, none of the moderators continued to be significant across both measurement types. So while it appears that empathy_training has a moderate_to_large_effect on increasing empathy, the way empathy is measured is important and moderates the strength of the effect. These findings lead to a discussion on the measurement of empathy, the components of empathy, and the very construct of empathy. The study_concludes_with_recommendations_for_further_research on empathy_training programs."
19701,"The general_purpose_of_this_study is to identify_the_principal_components of governmental policy affecting the Dominican agricultural_sector during the 1966-1986 period, to identify linkages with the macroeconomic policy, and to draw_general_welfare implications. Specific objectives are the following: (1) to identify the private_and_government_institutions dealing with agricultural_and_macroeconomic policies; (2) to identify_and_analyze the economic instruments influencing private_and_government_institutions_involved in agricultural_and_macroeconomic policies; (3) to identify and evaluate the linkages between and among the agricultural_sector and the rest of the economy; and (4) to develop and present a decision-making procedure_for_evaluating the social_benefits_and_costs of Dominican rice_policy on consumers, producers, and taxpayers. Policy instruments analyzed included agricultural credit; price_support schemes; machinery, seeds and irrigation_water subsidies; and direct capital_investment in the sector. The country's self-sufficiency policy goal is analyzed_from_the_perspective of price_support and fertilizer_subsidy alternatives under a second-best economic situation. Social benefits_and_costs are obtained through partial_equilibrium analysis, as well as foreign_exchange savings, distribution effects, and benefit/cost ratios. Results suggest that the policy goal is obtained at a lower government cost and, thus, a more relative efficient state_is_reached by using a fertilizer subsidy. A sensitivity_analysis was conducted. Two scenarios were addressed; first, rice and fertilizer prices were modified to allow prices to increase, and second, parameter_values (elasticities of rice supply, fertilizer demand, and fertilizer production) were modified. In all instances, producers' gain was accompanied with large governmental costs. The relative benefit/cost ratio (change) was greater_than_unity and a reduction in the deadweight losses was obtained under most fertilizer_subsidy alternative situations. The analysis_suggests a need for modification in Dominican agricultural policies to achieve its stated goal of self-sufficiency in rice_production at least cost. The overriding conclusion from this study is that all rice_policy programs analyzed yield less social_welfare than would free_market conditions. Nevertheless, the study_found that suboptimal efficiency improvements were possible with an alternative policy, namely a fertilizer_subsidy program. (Abstract shortened with permission of author.)"
28243,"African Americans came to the North_American_continent by the institution of slavery. As slaves, they were denied_the_rights and opportunities of other immigrant which migrated to this country. One of the opportunities_denied was education. Through legislation, litigation, and the Emancipation_Proclamation many African_American were allowed to become educated in the later 1800s and early 1900s. The educational_experiences that African_American_students_were_allowed to have prior to the late 1960s were through segregated institutions now called Historically_Black_Colleges_and_Universities (HBCU). Today, African_American_students are admitted to many different types of institutions. This study focused on the differences existing between a selected_group_of_African_American_students in attendance at either a historically Black or White_college or university in Mississippi. Comparisons have been made between African_American student populations on Black_and_White_college campuses. Predominantly Black colleges have frequently_served Black_students who otherwise would not have had an opportunity_to_attend college. These institutions pride themselves on the ability_to_meet the needs of financially disadvantaged, academically under-prepared Black_students and improve these deficiencies (Allen, 1985; Allen, 1986; Allen, 1988; Allen, 1992; Crosson, 1991). The subjects for this study were two convenience groups of African_American_undergraduate students--one group in attendance at public historically Black colleges_and_universities_in_Mississippi and a second group attending historically White_colleges_and_universities_in_the_state of Mississippi. The study_included approximately 300 students, (150 from historically Black colleges_and_universities and 150 from historically White colleges and universities). The instrument_used_in_this_study is ""The Diversity In The College Community: A Survey Of Student Opinions And Experiences"". The instrument, developed by Walter R. Allen, sociology professor at UCLA, has been through three pretests and revisions. The pretests were administered in 1979 and 1980 to students_at_the_University_of_Michigan and the University_of_North Carolina. The discriminant_function technique was used to test the H1. The discriminant_function with covariance_was_used_to_test H2-H6. The findings in the study clearly show differences between African_American students. The difference that are most contributing to the plethora_of_literature are in the area of perceived instruction of the HWCU students. African_American_students_experience a lack of encouragement by faculty. This is a problem, if student can not relate to the learning experience learning will not take place. The HBCU_students generally_found faculty on their campuses to be concerned about their well-being and giving encouragement. Based on this study findings these are qualities the HWCU faculty need to replicate. The findings_support the need for faculty to attempt_to_find more ways of showing support_and_encouragement to the students of color. The need to recruit_and_retain_African_American_faculty is a must. African_American_faculty is a novelty on HWCU campuses, but there should be a strong push toward recruitment of these faculty. If they cannot attract, then train the graduate_students present and encourage those students to obtain the degrees which would allow them to become faculty members. The study has merit toward the understanding of African_American_students in Mississippi. African_American_students on HBCU and HWCU college_campuses in Mississippi demonstrate differences, but the differences are expressions of diversity."
6082,"This dissertation_is_concerned_with_the_historical_and_contemporary_relationship between American_culture and subculture. The latter domain is particularized in the New York Bowery which became established as an urban place and theme during the late_nineteenth century. The dialectic between culture and subculture, stimulated by the historical processes of urban-industrialization and by the opposition between poverty_and_affluence in the metropolis, has been accompanied by the symbolic systems of mystification and critical realism. Both symbolic systems have functioned to organize social perceptions on the nature of urban_poverty and Bowery homelessness in such a way as to bring the contradictory viewpoints, ideological differences, and essential meanings into dynamic tension. The intensity and progression of the dialectic, though primarily examined during the late_nineteenth century, is also traced into the modern period. In regards to structure, Chapter 1, ""Background Circumference,"" includes a brief social_history of the Bowery, exploring its development from rural settlement to urban_slum and skid row. Chapter 2, ""Mystification,"" examines related approaches to the construct of urban_poverty in the Bowery which tend toward different degrees of social_distance and obscurity. The symbolic system of mystification is represented by the sensationalistic genre, the urban picturesque school, and by the realism of Jacob Riis's reportage and William_Dean Howells's commentary and fiction. Chapter 3, ""Descent and Discovery,"" contrasts the more removed approaches of those writers working within the framework of mystification with the penetration of urban_space highlighted by the proponents of critical realism. The Bowery sketches of Stephen_Crane and Theodore Dreiser's Sister_Carrie are presented to investigate this more intimate interaction. Chapter 4, ""Bowery Tales,"" continues the discussion on Crane's style of critical realism. Crane's novellas, Maggie: A Girl_of_the_Streets and George's Mother, are studied for their perspectives on American_urban_life in the 1890s. The conclusion transports the dialectic between culture and subculture, and the competing expressions of mystification and critical realism, into our present era. In doing so, that otherwise silent minority, the Bowery homeless, demonstrate the vitality of the dialectic and the generative culture-making process that ensues."
53672,"This study of marginality is aimed towards achievement of an understanding of the phenomenon, as it is experienced by Orthodox_Jewish social_work_students at the Wurzweiler School of Social Work of Yeshiva_University in 1979. Through the theoretical_framework of marginality, the identification and anatomy of conflicts experienced by this group were examined. This, then, provided the basis for the full-scale study, both in terms of conceptualization and measurement. Various assumptions concerning the multiple identifications, commitments, roles, values, and cultures of Orthodox_Jewish social_work_students were described. The work_of_Robert_Park and Everett Stonequist was analyzed in some detail. Various frameworks and definitions around religion and Orthodoxy, the culture and values of the social_work profession, and the meaning of values were explored. The emergent relationships as between religion and profession, in terms of confrontation with secularization, universalism versus particularism as well as absolutism versus relativism were juxtaposed. Personality, culture and culture_shock and concepts such as the ""whole self"" in professional_social_work education, identity, socialization, group membership, and identification were all brought together to constitute the theoretical antecedents of the study. The methodology and design of the research were rooted in Glaser and Strauss's strategy of ""grounded theory"" from which a multi-staged inquiry was developed, and divided into an exploratory stage and a full-scale study stage, the procedures and findings of which formed the body of the study. One hundred ten_students participated. The major_hypothesis of the study, that variations in original value orientations or religious self-descriptions, would constitute the major_factor yielding differential impacts on conflicts and strategies, was fully substantiated. A theoretical_adaptational_model of Orthodox_Jewish social_work students' negotiation with social_work was developed_on_the_basis of grounded theory, that is, via constant interaction with and analysis of the data. The findings, therefore, legitimate and support_the_theory of marginality. Its ensuant implications provide social_work educators with new insights and understandings of a marginal group of students, the nature of their conflicts, and their strategies of negotiation and resolution of conflict."
30618,"Models of lesbian_and_gay_identity_development suggest that identity disclosure is an integral_aspect of the development process. Lesbian self-disclosure of identity was related_to_a_number_of_factors in the literature that have been linked with disclosure. Two hundred thirty-one women from two geographical regions participated in a mail-out survey. The survey measured the number_of_people to whom women had disclosed and whether they had disclosed to family, heterosexual friends, homosexual friends, and coworkers. The survey also included_measures of internalized homophobia, perceived homophobia in family, perceived homophobia in other heterosexuals, feminism, self-esteem, current involvement in a relationship, and a series of demographic questions. The results from multiple_regression_analyses on self-disclosure indicate that the factors associated with self-disclosure differ according to the target of the disclosure. Internalized homophobia was associated with the number_of_categories_of_people_told and whether the woman had disclosed to coworkers and employers; it was not a factor in disclosure_to_friends or family. The perceived homophobia of friends, coworkers and employers, and families was associated with disclosure to these groups. Age was found_to_be_a_factor with disclosure to family and coworkers, as well as amount of disclosure, such that younger_women were more likely to have disclosed_their_sexual_orientation to more categories of people--especially family and coworkers. Feminism was the only factor strongly associated with disclosure to homosexual friends. Cultural differences also were discovered between women from the two geographical locations. Women from Utah were younger, predominantly raised in a conservative_religious faith, and less likely to have a feminist_viewpoint than California women. Utah_women_perceived more homophobia in their families but disclosed to their families at the same rate as California women. Finally, Utah_women had more recently_begun disclosing their sexual_orientation to heterosexual friends. The findings indicate that increasing self-disclosure may be a marker of lesbian_identity development. Results also suggest that theories of the relationship of self-disclosure to identity must include an understanding of the effects of sociopolitical culture on the lesbian self-disclosure process."
36825,"In the United_States and throughout the Americas there exist many communities of multiethnic, multicultural, and multiracial ancestry. These groups represent an aspect of American_Indian_identity that is seldom addressed-the amalgamation of some indigenous_tribes into new ethnic communities. The Creoles of southwest_Louisiana are but one of these communities. Scholars and researchers in the nineteenth_and_twentieth_centuries have declared that many native communities ""died out"" due to disease, malnutrition, and European colonization. Indigenous groups such as the Atakapa Indians in southwest_Louisiana have been dismissed as groups of the ""past"" that no longer exist, they have been cast as one of many ""extinct"" indigenous populations in the Americas. I will argue however, that not only do groups such as the Atakapa still exist, but they exist in a new complex hybrid_form which thrives today within multiethnic and multicultural groups such as the Creole of Color communities in Louisiana, California, and Texas. An extensive_examination of Creoles of Color provides an important case_study for understanding how other multiethnic populations throughout the Americas have blended with Indian groups to create a multiethnic American_Indian diaspora. This project_expands the ways_in_which_racial_identity_and_racial_formation can be articulated within a sociological_and_historical_tradition by noting the two to three hundred_year_history of Creoles as colonial and decolonial hybrids. This study will bring_into_question just exactly who and what are Creoles of Color? The study will also address ways that definitions of this community changed over time due to the economic, social, and political_interests of Anglo Americans entering Louisiana in the late_nineteenth_and_early_twentieth centuries. The project delves into the questions of how and why certain multiethnic populations are or are not recognized as American_Indian communities. The two essential_questions_I_attempt_to_answer in the dissertation are: Do mixed-race Creole populations with American_Indian_ancestry maintain/retain their ethnic_ties to Indian/tribal cultures as they change socially, legally, economically and regionally? Have tribes that were ""wiped out"" in Louisiana disappeared into extinction, or have they blended into a network of multiethnic Creole-Indian enclaves living across the U.S. and in parts of Mexico and the Caribbean? In answering these two questions, I hope to address the ways in which Creoles of Color, as a case study, inform sociological thinking about the cultural, legal, and racial_status of Creoles_and_Indians in the United States."
28128,"The Ohio_River_Valley was the center of the Trans-Appalachian West. Jewish_merchants and land investors operated there during the colonial_and_early_national eras. In the 1820s and 1830s, Jews_began_to_settle permanently; in 1824 the first synagogue was organized in Cincinnati. Though the Valley moved beyond its frontier stage by 1825, it was still a Jewish frontier, a place of contact between the old and the new. The diversity of religious_groups in the Valley made it the first testing-ground for religious_pluralism in America. The Ohio_River Valley's Jewish communities were built by immigrants from Central_Europe in the 1830s-1860s. Jewish migration_patterns were linked to the growth of commerce in the Valley and to similar European background. Jews created networks of business, social, and religious support in small towns throughout the Valley. In most small towns, the dominant Jewish institution was the synagogue, whose activities included mutual aid, philanthropy, and Jewish education. In the mid-nineteenth century, the Ohio_Valley was the center of a movement for an Americanized Reform Judaism. Small Jewish communities there played a vital_role in constructing Reform_Judaism and its institutions. Jews saw themselves--and were seen--as simultaneously similar and different. Emphasizing shared_values and interests, small_town Jews affirmed the notion of ""progress"" central to small-town boosterism. The mass immigration_of_Eastern_European_Jews (1880-1920) coincided with new economic_opportunities in some small Ohio_River towns. The immigrants replenished the population_of_small Jewish communities, even as their integration created challenges. In the 1920s and 1930s, Jewish_population and institutional strength reached their peak in most of the small towns. But from the 1950s through the 1990s, this situation was increasingly unsustainable. Small Jewish communities confronted population loss and the aging of their remaining constituents. In towns all along the Ohio River, congregations were forced to merge or even to disband."
40915,"Social disorganization theory, developed by Shaw_and_McKay (1942) in the early_to_mid 1900s, is usually considered a macro-level theory of criminal_behavior and therefore has been almost exclusively used to explain_variation in crime rates. However, Shaw_and_McKay also discussed how their theory could explain micro-level variation in social controls, peer associations, and delinquency. Little research has focused on this aspect of their theory. In this study the connections between the macro_level theory_of_social_disorganization and the micro_level theories of social bonding and peer_influence were explicated and empirically tested. It was argued that to the degree adolescents' neighborhoods could be considered ""socially disorganized"" they would display attenuated social bonds, a greater_likelihood of associating with delinquent peers, and a greater level of drug use themselves. The macro-level data, used to measure neighborhood characteristics, were from the 1990 census and the micro_level data, used to measure social bonds, peer associations, and drug use, were self-reports from 8th grade students, collected in 1990 in conjunction with an evaluation by a drug_prevention program. Students were linked to neighborhoods by use of their address. Hierarchical Linear Modeling, a technique well suited to the analysis of hierarchically organized data such as those employed here, was used to test the hypotheses. The results are supportive of many of the linkages implied in the integrated_theoretical framework. However, they also suggest that social_disorganization_theory should be revised somewhat to incorporate changes in the structure_of_neighborhoods that have occurred since Shaw_and_McKay wrote their theory."
31712,"The purpose_of_this_investigation_was_to_evaluate the developmental_precursors of orientation to ideal_versus ought standards in a sample of 6-7 yr. old children. Goal orientation can be defined as differential_sensitivity (in perception, self-evaluation, and behavior) to interpersonal or intrapersonal stimuli as a function of the desired and/or undesired outcomes those stimuli represent. Orientations towards particular kinds of goals, the relative_importance of which presumably vary across individuals, are postulated to develop from a combination of temperament and patterns of experience within the process of socialization. Based on self-discrepancy theory (SDT; Higgins, 1987), I proposed a distinction between nurturance-oriented parenting that instills a promotion (ideal) regulatory_focus in children and security-oriented parenting that instills a prevention (ought) regulatory focus. In two factor_analytic studies, a clearly interpretable_factor_structure for parenting_behaviors was obtained using data from two studies--Sears, Maccoby, and Levin (1952), and the Wisconsin Family and Work Study (1995), both conducted when children were 5 years old. These factors_were_labeled nurturance , punishmen , and control , and were proposed to vary according to the goal orientations they are hypothesized to produce in the child. Evidence for the discriminant_validity of the factors was obtained in the third study, wherein distinct_patterns of associations were observed between dimensions of maternal_and_child_temperament and the parenting behavior factors. In the fourth study, children's response latencies to interview questions--reflecting strength of orientation toward a promotion (ideal) focus versus a prevention (ought) focus--were found to be discriminantly predicted_by_parenting_behaviors_and_child temperament. Structural equation_modeling_showed that maternal_nurturance discriminantly predicted strength of orientation to ideal standards, whereas maternal punishment showed independent curvilinear and interactive effects (with maternal control) on strength of orientation to ought standards. Child temperament was observed to be a moderator of the associations between maternal_parenting_behaviors and strength of ideal_versus ought goal orientation. These findings_support_a_developmental_model of the acquisition of goal_orientation and provide_a_framework to study prospectively the motivational and emotional_consequences of goal_orientation to ideal_versus ought standards."
38311,"Approximately fifteen_percent_of_the_population will experience infertility sometime during their reproductive lives. Infertility_is_experienced as a personal crisis with disturbing biological, psychological, and social consequences. Infertile individuals must draw on their personal_strengths and cultures_to_construct_an_understanding of themselves as infertile. Infertility knows no boundaries and crosses gender, cultural, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Yet, infertility studies have focused_predominantly on a narrow sample of the infertile population: mainly a homogenous group of Caucasian_women who have substantial educational and financial resources, and who proactively_seek medical resolution. Culturally diverse_populations are not adequately represented in the infertility research and literature. Guided by general systems theory--including a biopsychosocial perspective--and social_construction theory, this dissertation is an exploratory, qualitative, and heuristic study. It attempts to understand infertility as a biopsychosocial phenomenon and to determine_the_specific influences on the narrative_interpretation of infertility by previously_unstudied infertile populations. Ten culturally_diverse_women from Native American, Hispanic, African-American, and Moslem backgrounds are interviewed in depth. No attempt_is_made_to_compare this sample with any other population. Description, analysis, and interpretation_of_the_data focus on the participants' narrative_construction of infertility as women from diverse cultures. The significant categories of influence on their narratives were identified as: ethnicity and culture, life expectations, feelings about self, and support systems. This study_concludes that participants desire resolution. However, based on their personal backgrounds and cultures, participants develop dominant coping strategies--defeatists, resigners, and deniers--which result in ""irresolution"". In each case, participants lacked culturally_sensitive and appropriate opportunities to construct positive narratives of their infertility that could help them to more adequately_resolve their infertility. Social work is identified as an appropriate profession to address the biopsychosocial needs of the infertile populations, particularly culturally diverse populations. Social work professionals should continue to research infertility, as well as provide increased infertility counseling, and promote culturally_sensitive attitudes toward infertility. The social_work_profession should also advocate for the interests of all infertile populations through policy_development and regulation of the medical and insurance industries."
3118,"The purpose_of_this_study is to document the adjustment_process of Chinese_immigrant_children_and_youth in New York_City_during_the_late 1970s: (1) to see if the immigrant_experience is as stressful and disorganizing as the sociological_literature relates for immigrants in the past, (2) to look at the unfolding processes of adapting to a new life in a new country. (3) to pinpoint problem_areas as well as support systems and coping mechanisms, (4) to take note of the changes that have occurred within the family, the school, and the community within the context of a more receptive social_climate than that of past decades, (5) to draw some conclusions as to the level of social and psychological_adjustment attained by these children and youths, and (6) to relate their experiences to sociological theories_pertaining to uprooting, social change, cultural conflict, networking, status and roles, community cohesiveness, minority status, and the like. This study provides specific_information about the community, the institutions, and the social_milieu that the children are catapulted into as well as the actual experiences that the children undergo in their adaptation. The approach is a holistic one, viewing the children in their total setting. Answers_were_sought more along the lines of concrete_manifestations rather than merely on verbal_responses and participant observation, although both these research techniques were employed. The study hypothesizes that with the improved social_climate and the more tolerant attitude of the American_people toward ethnic minorities since the Civil_Rights_Act of 1964, the experiences of new immigrants have been correspondingly more favorable and the immigrant_experience less stressful. The subjects were children_and_youth from three levels of public schools in New York's Chinatown and a suburban ""satellite"" Chinatown. Successful or unsuccessful adjustment was measured by concrete indicators such as school_performance and gang involvement. The children's outlook that immigration was an opportunity for a better life and that education was the channel to their goals provided strong_motivation toward high_academic achievement. Social institutions such as the school, the community, and the family served as strong props in the relatively healthy adjustment experiences of the children. The most disquieting syndrome was the lack_of_parental presence in the home."
27858,"This dissertation_advances_our_understanding of the assimilation processes of post-1965 immigrants and their descendants. In particular, I select issues that have not been intensively examined before, addressing three major_life_events during adulthood, including college education, union formation, and labor_market outcomes, to investigate adaptation_processes_of_immigrants and their offspring. Chapter 2 examines the possible educational pathways the new second immigrant_generation may take during transition to adulthood. To assess their degree of assimilation, I make two levels of comparison. At the first level, I examine horizontal intergenerational_mobility by comparing the educational_status of the new second generation with their parents. I find that the new second-generation youth, as a whole, are doing better than their parents in high_school graduation. However, the pace and degree_of_intergenerational_mobility varies by ethnic backgrounds regarding college education. At the second level, I assess vertical inter-class mobility by comparing the educational_status of the new second generation with the third- and higher-generation non-Hispanic white_peers (mainstream proxy). I find that there is stratification of college_education for interclass mobility. While Mexican Americans are much less likely to attend_college than their third- and higher-generation white counterparts, Cuban Americans and Asian Americans are more likely to go on with college_education than their third- and plus-generation non-Hispanic white generation. Disadvantaged groups, like Mexican Americans and those of other Central-South American_and_Caribbean origins, lag behind in such social_factors as parental human capital, family structure, and family size, which contribute to reduce their likelihood of college_education and probably their eventual lower_status in American stratification system. Chapter 3 examines union_formation processes among young_adults of different immigrant generations during transition to adulthood. As living together without marrying becomes a common_phenomenon among young_adults in American society, one may ask whether immigrant descendants who are raised in ethnic_Asian or Hispanic_families will take the union_formation pattern of cohabitation as their native peers do. This chapter provides strong and robust_evidence regarding that first generation youth are less likely to embrace the alternative union_formation path of cohabitation in the presence of cultural, structural, and contextual controls, as compared to the third and highergeneration non-Hispanic white peers. In addition, the first generation is more likely to take the traditional route of marriage during early adulthood. Chapter 4 shifts the research_attention to examine the economic adaptation processes of contemporary_Asian_and_Hispanic_immigrants in comparison to their native peers in the context of a segmented_labor market. I first re-define the U.S. labor_market into four segments: non-enclave primary segment, non-enclave secondary segment, enclave-primary segment, and enclave-secondary segment. I then focus on the impact of various nativity and immigrant statuses on labor_market outcomes, including labor segment membership, hourly wages, and non-monetary job benefits, among immigrants. I find that native-born and naturalized citizenship are more advantageous statuses than non-permanent residency and permanent residency to incorporate immigrants_and_their_descendants into the mainstream_labor_market and facilitate their attainment of higher_wages and more job benefits. Non-naturalized immigrants are much more likely to be concentrated in ethnic enclaves and in lower_rungs of the open market, and subject to lower pay and fewer_benefits due to their inferior immigrant statuses."

179,"Violent political_conflict in Cambodia has persisted for over thirty_years despite a 1991 UN-brokered peace agreement. A 1975-1989 neorealist period created a hostile domestic environment, causing a cycle of violence. The regional balance of power, the acceptability of the use of force, and the primacy of nation-state actors caused this cycle. Hard-line, militaristic domestic_political_leaders ascended because of foreign patronage, and are inherently unwilling to compromise. This combination has sustained the top-down authoritarian approach to political rule, which has concomitantly retarded the organic growth of non-violent civil society. The post-Cold War_international neoliberal shift was flawed. The colonially-constructed state and the externally-driven cycle_of_violence have weakened traditional royal_authority and legitimacy. International negotiations ignored the domestic_context and the need to build trust between individuals and groups. Thus, foreign institution-building is an incomplete step towards conflict_resolution which must also address domestic_political methods, local socioeconomic conditions, and indigenous culture."

Despite the fact that pluralistic ideology appears to be one of the best approaches applied to the ethnically_diverse American population, the goals_and_objectives of multicultural_education still remain unclear.

The study was divided into two parts: (a) The development of an exemplary unit of art instruction designed_to_foster_the_development of more positive_attitudes toward different racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious_groups among Mexican-American students, and (b) The testing of the effectiveness of the model through an initial experimental_study involving an intact class of third grade Mexican-American students. The test_design selected for use in this study was the ""Nonrandomized Control-group Pretest-Posttest Design,"" which was judged to be appropriate when working with intact_classes for experimental_and_control groups. The subjects were third grade_students of Mexican-American heritage enrolled in Hodges Elementary School in Lubbock, Texas. The proposed treatment administered by the experimenter, acting as art instructor, required an entire semester. In this treatment, the independent variable was the MAAC administered_to_the_experimental_group of third grade Mexican-American students. The dependent variable was the impact of the MAAC on: (1) Multicultural sensitivity, or the development_of_positive_attitudes toward different racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious groups, and (2) Aesthetic sensitivity, or an increased_understanding of the art elements and principles to achieve an overall sense of visual unity. The findings_of_this_study_provide data and procedure modifications that will be valuable in future_research_efforts focusing on the development of more positive_student_attitudes_pertaining to different racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious groups."
49928,"This study of the Commonwealth of Virginia's higher educational_policy toward black_Virginians attempts_to_answer the following two questions: (1) are the present disparities in higher_educational_attainment_levels of African Americans and white_Americans attributable to state_action or differences in individual circumstances; and (2) to what extent have federal_desegregation policies altered the effects of the segregationist_policies_and_practices on black access_to_higher education? The study has shown that, within the Commonwealth of Virginia, there are indisputable linkages between state_action and black access to (and representation in) public education. Beginning in 1902, for example, the Commonwealth_of_Virginia developed and implemented policies that had as their central_aim restricting the higher educional options of black Virginians. These policies_and_practices permeated_the_entire_structure of state_government (i.e., the patterns of official behavior that have persisted over time) and they effectively achieved their intended results. In the years between 1902 and 1923, this included a total ban on all forms of public_higher_education that were then provided to white residents. And from 1923 up until the Adams decisions of 1973, the state_mandated and achieved inequality of public_higher educational_opportunities for black Virginians. Finally, the study_demonstrates that the measures required of the Commonwealth_of_Virginia by federal_desegregation_policy have not succeeded in alleviating all of the effects of official discrimination. This outcome is attributable to the very structure of American government, which guarantees the state a central_role_in_the_development_and_implementation_of_federal higher_education desegration policy."
42257,"This research_study has explored the kinds of thoughts that therapists report having had in response to their experiences with therapy failures. The central_goal was to develop_a_model for organizing therapists' thoughts to form a basis for further investigations into therapists' conceptual processes for coping with and learning from therapy failures. The methodological approaches used in this study were designed to conform to a set of hermeneutic and social_constructionist assumptions about the development and function of ""meaning making,"" as it applies to both psychological_research and the therapeutic relationship. Thus, the research_methods replicated a social_construction process, using a ""community"" of participants for all stages of data gathering and analyses. The application of Thought Listing and Multiple Sorting Procedures in combination with Cluster and Multidimensional Scaling Analyses yielded a three dimensional_solution with which to organize these therapists' thoughts. Additional_findings_suggest that the ways in which therapists examine therapy failures is socially constructed and may function to preserve therapists' core beliefs. The three dimensional_solution challenges the usefulness of an exclusively causal_model for understanding therapists' reflections on failures."
43070,"For years, researchers have debated whether parental_alcoholism has an effect on the children_living in the home. To date, there has been contradictory_evidence found concerning cognitive skills, self-esteem levels, behavioral problems_and_psychological_problems between children_of_alcoholic_parents_and_children of non-alcoholic parents. In studying the stage theory of Erickson, the environmental perception theory of Adler, and the progression of alcoholism theory of Jackson, it is logical to surmise that this population would develop problems. Thirty-two children with alcoholic_fathers and 32 matched_children from non-alcoholic homes completed three measures--thePersonality Inventory for Children, the Culture Free Self Esteem Inventory, and the Child and Adolescent Profile. Paired sample t-tests, independent_samples t-tests, and ANOVAs were used to determine whether differences_existed in the above four areas. Comparative analyses_supported the following conclusions: (1) children_of_alcoholic_fathers are as bright as those in non-alcoholic homes, but are far less effective in schools; (2) compared with their normal peers, such children_suffer_from_low self-esteem, at home, at school and in society; (3) as a group, children_of_alcoholic_fathers are poorly adjusted, being hostile, dependent and school delinquent, with poor_social_skills and poor_peer relations; (4) as a group, such children_suffer from depression, somatic complaints, withdrawal and psychotic thoughts; (5) the families of the two groups did not differ in their willingness to reveal_information about their families; (6) there are no age or sex_differences_with_regard to the sequelae of paternal alcoholism, although there is some evidence which reflects an interactive effect only; and, (7) children_of_alcoholics who are from a lower socio-economic status either stayed the same or got better, whereas the children_of_alcoholics from a higher socio-economic status deteriorated with age in terms of impulse control, general adjustment, delinquency and hostility."
29484,"This dissertation_examines the development of Chinese immigration in California and in Madagascar between 1850-1882 and 1896-1940, respectively. This study points out the international_dimension of the issue of Chinese immigration in that it places these two population_movements from China within the context of nineteenth-century Western_imperialism and colonialism. The economic reorganization of conquered_territories or colonial possessions, and the exploitation of local resources, necessitated the importation of outside labor and attracted different groups of settlers. However, when the presence of the immigrants became threatening, or was perceived as such, on political, economic, social, or racial grounds, severe limitations were imposed on their number and their activities. This research_attempts to determine why two groups of Chinese_immigrants who came from relatively similar backgrounds, and who were in many ways related, developed differently in the two areas under study. Emphasis is placed on major political, economic, and social_factors that accounted for variations in the forms of settlement of these Chinese immigrants. It was found that the political, economic_and_social_structures largely_determined the position and the role of the immigrants in each society. In California, the interplay of class and race worked against the Chinese. They were caught_in_the_midst of a class_struggle in which the strong influence of the labor_movement contributed to the passage of the 1882 Exclusion Act. In Madagascar, the small anti-Chinese opposition was mitigated by the hesitant French_policy toward the Chinese, on the basis of two main factors: (1) the Chinese played a vital_role in the colonial system_of_economic exploitation; and, (2) the colonial_government remained constantly cautious about the international_impact of its immigration policy."

52333,"Ethnographic field_study_examined the formation of symbolic_boundaries and social identities in a rural area centered on a small, predominantly Euro-American town on the Nez_Perce Indian reservation. The Euro-American population has increased in the 1990s by a flow of in-migration, especially from urban_areas in other states. In a complex cultural_milieu of ethnic, religious, occupational, political, and lifestyle diversity, residents were most sensitive_to_differences based on length_of_residence and tribal or nonIndian status. Community cohesion is theorized as a product of the direct and combined_effects of several elements, including common values, common material interests, primary networks and warm feelings. It is seen in processes of negotiation rather than permanent structures. Members see the Indian and nonIndian communities as culturally and racially distinct. Acquaintance and friendship cross the boundaries between groups, but organized activities tend to be separate. The Euro-American majority has historically_dominated the town culturally as well as materially; tribal_members are now more actively asserting their role in the community. To what extent recent_migrants will integrate with the existing communities is not yet clear. Identities of all groups are strongly tied to the land. Land carries value as homeland, resource base, and natural amenity. Other values are shared across groups, but these have not prevented a historic pattern of dominance and subordination. Euro-Americans expect the Nez_Perce to dissolve as a people, while the Nez_Perce have a strong_sense of tribal identity. ""Reactive cohesion"" is high, as all groups combine to meet externally_caused crises. ""Proactive cohesion"" is low, as institutions for developing intergroup_understanding are almost nonexistent. One observed mechanism for protecting community_solidarity is to cast dissidents in the role of Outsider."

7840,"Discussions of multilingualism in Taiwan have focused on language as a marker of ethnicity in academic and political discourse, as exemplified by the current bentuhua or ""nativization"" movement. The promotion of ideologies which link language with ethnicity has obscured links between language and other aspects of identity, thus masking social inequalities which they reproduce. This study_analyzes ideologies that link linguistic_forms to dimensions of class, gender, educational level, occupation, and lifestyles, thus maintaining the diglossic relationship where Mandarin enjoys H status, while Taiwanese (the local variety) is associated with aspects of L culture. Further, It examines how these ideologies_are_reproduced within dominant structures, such as educational institutions, on the example of student_and_teacher_language_attitudes in a Taipei_County high school. Finally, it demonstrates how the use of Taiwan_Mandarin linguistic features, by ""localizing"" the dominant variety and thus claiming ownership of it, represents speakers' agency in resisting dominant structures and re-negotiating social relationships. In this study, Taiwan_Mandarin is described as a continuum of features from most prestigious (the idealized Standard Mandarin) to most stigmatized (the imagined stereotype of a Taiwanese ""accent""). Different features are used selectively by speakers to construct different and contextualized aspects of identities. A variation analysis of two Taiwan_Mandarin features--de-retroflection of sibilant fricative initials and labio-velar glide deletion [w[open o]] [arrow right] [[open o]]--shows that local_features are more likely to be used by students who identify with local networks, such as those studying in vocational classes, and less likely to be used by students who identify with the values_and_norms of the school institution and plan_to_attend college. This study_demonstrates the operation of language_ideologies at the level of linguistic practice and its relationship to dominant discourses."
6577,"Each year, over half_a_million American_teenagers become parents. While some are able parents, others experience difficulties in fulfilling the role. In the past decade, research has become increasingly concerned with teen parenting issues. Yet, factors associated with adequate parenting have not been ascertained. In order_to_optimize the service outcomes, it is crucial that social_work_practitioners identify_factors_that_enable teens to function adequately as parents. The purpose_of_the_present_research_was_to_investigate_the_relationship of parenting adequacy of teen_mothers and their self esteem, locus of control, and their use of family_support_systems_and_community services. The research_was_conducted using a random_sample of 152 teen_mothers from the Teenage Services Act (TASA) programs, administered by Human Resources Administration (HRA), New York City. The instruments in this study_included HOME Inventory, Self-Esteem Scale, Locus_of_Control_Scale and a scale constructed by the researcher to measure family support, service_utilization and other demographics. The research identified the psychological variables, self esteem and locus_of_control as having higher impact on parenting adequacy than all support systems. Teen mothers with high_self_esteem or internal_locus_of_control_were_found to be more adequate parents than mothers with low_self_esteem or external_locus of control. Among African_American mothers, a combination of self esteem, locus_of_control and service_support explained 38% of parenting adequacy. Among the Hispanics, however, self esteem was the only predictor of parenting adequacy."
31683,"Sixteen million_Americans served_in_the_armed_forces during the Second World War, more than in any other conflict. This work_explores_the_process of veteran readjustment to civilian_life_in_the_United_States following World_War II. It discusses the various problems veterans faced in returning to civilian society, as well as the political response to the turbulence in the lives of returning veterans. After World_War II, veterans' programs covered a wider_range of readjustment issues than ever before. As a result, veterans' programs following the war were remarkably effective in assisting soldiers to become civilians again. Key to the development of veterans' programs was overwhelming public support. Never before--or since--had Americans taken such a keen_interest in veterans' affairs. As this study suggests, there were several reasons for such immense support. First, the sheer_size of the World_War_II veteran_population demanded that the nation_face_the_issue squarely. Second, Americans feared the potential_threat maladjusted veterans might pose to the social_and_political order. The work_focuses on veterans' affairs in Wisconsin, and covers state_and_local programs, as well as those of the federal government. It is composed of six topical chapters, arranged so as to follow a veteran through the readjustment process. An introductory_essay_discusses_the_history of veterans before World_War II, a troubled_past that greatly shaped debate over veterans' affairs in the 1940s. Chapter One outlines_the_development of federal, state, and local services available to veterans, as well as the rationale and political_pressures behind them. Chapter Two explores personal readjustments to civilian life, including discussions of the veteran's emotional state, marriage_and_family life, and veterans' organizations. Chapter Three examines the medical readjustments_many_veterans faced, ranging from physical to psychological problems. Chapter Four focuses on educational_benefits for veterans, and Chapter Five discusses the reestablishment of the veteran back into the nation's economy. Chapter Six discusses housing_programs for veterans. Generally speaking, this study_explores_the_process of veteran readjustment between 1945 and 1950."
772,"This study_investigates_the_acquisition_of_speech_rhythm by bilingual Spanish- and English-speaking children between four and five years of age, and it compares their performance to that of their monolingual age-matched peers in both languages, as well as to the performance_of_monolingual_and_bilingual adults. Participants_included younger_children (between 3;9 and 4;5,15), older_children (between 4;6,18 and 5;2), and adults (over 18 years). All age_groups had data collected from bilingual_speakers_of_English_and_Spanish as well as monolingual age-matched peers in both languages. A sentence_elicitation_task was used to obtain_the_data_recorded directly onto a notebook_computer using an external sound_card and a wireless lavalier microphone system. The child participants' hearing and language were also evaluated to ensure typical and age-appropriate language_skills and normal hearing. Sixty-four samples_were_collected and later analyzed via durational_variability calculations of vocalic and intervocalic intervals based on E. Grabe and E. Low's (2002) normalized Pairwise Variability Index (PVI) measures so as to investigate the speech_rhythm production of the participants. The results_revealed that younger bilingual_children_displayed distinct speech_rhythm_patterns for their target languages, but they also tended to deviate from their monolingual English-speaking peers, showing language interaction and somewhat of an equal speech timing bias. Older bilingual_children also produced_significant separation of speech rhythm, and differences between older bilingual_children_and_their_monolingual_peers_speaking_English were also found. Comparisons between younger_and_older bilingual_children indicated an effect for the vocalic PVI measure, but not for the intervocalic PVI, providing partial support for maturational differences for bilingual children. Contrasts between bilingual_adults and bilingual_children illustrated the existence of age effects. Furthermore, bilingual_adults also show separation of their languages on the whole and do not differ on measures of speech_rhythm from their monolingual_peers in either language. Further analyses suggested that the normalized vocalic PVI measure was more stable and had more power to differentiate languages than the intervocalic PVI. Post-hoc analyses also found the normalized vocalic PVI to be unaffected by including or excluding the final vowel."
4311,"Young, educated women, ages 25-35, are a transitional generation between their mothers who might have wanted more than the role of housewife, but lacked the autonomy, assertion, ambition or the social_climate to seek it; and the next generation who will take for granted the opportunities their mothers will have struggled for, to gain admission to, and succeed in careers while trying to integrate family roles. This exploratory_study looks at parental influences/attitudes; today's greater choices re: careers, marital status, and childrearing; and the resultant stresses and satisfactions. This population represents a new phenomenon; a literature_search showed little empirical data, a large ""N"" was thus desirable. An anonymous_questionnaire published in the alumnae magazine of Columbia_University elicited 537 usable_responses from women in a variety of careers. A comparison group, a sample of alumnae from Marymount College, a small, urban college, received the questionnaire yielding 104 usable responses. Conclusions from the data were: (1) parental influences/attitudes did not appear to affect choices; (2) respondents saw themselves as good role models for younger women; (3) women have greater choice than earlier generations, but felt more choice is stressful; (4) respondents were not anxious about their choices, but felt role conflict; (5) respondents did not show_evidence of stress on self-esteem, mastery or depression scales, but experienced_stress in combining roles; (6) work was the most stressful role, but most important to self-esteem; (7) married_women without children were most concerned whether and when to have children; and (8) single_women in established relationships showed a strong_commitment_to_work and seemed content with their lifestyle. Much of the stress appears to be transactional and indicates the need for social_service practice intervention in the form of support_groups and policy intervention in mobilizing changes in legislation and in the workplace to help alleviate_stress on women trying to successfully cope with more than one role."
36621,"Parent involvement_in_public schools became an educational_reform issue of national importance in 1998 with the passage of Goals 2000: Educate America Act. Goal #8 called for every school to promote_partnerships with parents. National Standards for Parent/Family Involvement were developed through the National_Coalition for Parent Involvement in Education, with representation from the many national education stakeholder organizations. For decades, research had indicated the critical_link between student_success and parent involvement. At the national level, stakeholders collaborated to define parent involvement, as well as, the roles_and_responsibilities for parent_involvement in day-to-day classroom activities, local policy, and individual initiatives. However, national efforts_to_institutionalize parent_involvement with scripted language calling for reform or change within the complex, loosely coupled, tangled hierarchies of the open organizational system_of_public_schools needed to be examined_in_light of its relevance for understanding the relationships, interactions, and interpretations of local stakeholders. Using institutional_theory_as_a_lens to examine multiple stakeholders' perceptions of parent involvement, this case_study_was_conducted in a California_school district. This unified school district is unique with its history of inclusive collaborative union negotiations and a high-level of district-wide, integrated parent_involvement practices. The local stakeholder_groups_represented include: parents, teachers/union, administrators_and_school_board members. Stakeholders defined parent_involvement and expressed their understanding of different stakeholder_roles_and_responsibilities in interviews and a focus group. Years of participant observations_were_conducted to deepen the understanding of how stakeholders' perceptions_affect action. Local stakeholders' perceptions_were_compared_and_contrasted with the content and language in national, state, and local documents on parent involvement. Documents representing governmental legislation and mandates, professional and membership stakeholder organizations, local policies, and classroom_practices were analyzed. From this analysis, a dominant_language that was structural, functional, and prescriptive surfaced. In the final analysis, parent_involvement in schools can be understood as being institutionalized as a loosely_coupled component of a tightly linked, tangled hierarchy. However, traditional patterns of teacher_autonomy and symbolic parent_involvement remained, serving to maintain_the_status quo."
33332,"This dissertation_examines transformations in the meanings_and_practices of gender, sexuality, marriage, and family in Shanghai, China in the 1990s. It is based_on_ethnographic_research undertaken in 1993 and 1994-1995 among middle- and upper-class Shanghainese women between the ages of 18 and 50. It incorporates data from in-depth interviews_with_women about their sexual_and_marital practices, along with analyses of television, radio, advice hotlines, and other mass_media that shape_public_discourse about these topics. It also draws from the author's role in a television_drama addressing themes of gender and transnational marriage in Shanghai. In the 1990s, Shanghai's upwardly mobile, elite_women are icons of mainland modernity. Their lifestyles and values reflect active engagement with the economic and sexual opportunities_presented by China's opening to the West. However, their sexual openness poses a threat_to_the_stability of the Chinese family. Widespread concerns over moral decay and social instability accompanying economic_reform have led_to_a_resurgence of discourses about ""traditional"" values, including the virtuous wife, good_mother ideal. This ideal positions women as ballasts of family and social stability during a time of rapid social change. Women must therefore negotiate between competing_demands to be open and modern and to uphold Chinese family_values as a basis for achieving the nation's modernization goals. Thus, women and sexuality serve as tactical objects in the realignment of state, family, and capitalist power in 1990s China. At the same time, women manipulate the importance placed on their virtue to pursue their sexual_and_marital desires. Identifying with the virtuous wife, good_mother_ideal allows women to conform to the family regime of power, even as they engage_in_sexual_practices afforded by the capitalist regime. This accommodation is possible in part because the socialist_state no longer positions itself uniformly against these alternate regimes. Rather, they are largely aligned in the constitution of a Chinese_modernity based on openness and stability. Cultural transformations in sexuality, marriage, and family in 1990s Shanghai are therefore a product of both the realignment of power structures in China, and women's own agency."

30569,"This study intends to identify the aspects of the Ugandan teachers' jobs and work_environment perceived by selective participants as satisfactory, as well as those perceived as less satisfactory or unsatisfactory. The study_is_based_on_the_assumption that teachers, being directly_involved in the current activities of educational institutions, have an in-depth understanding of the way these institutions are functioning, and of their organizational objectives. Therefore, the study assumes that teachers could provide_accurate_information about the degree to which institutional objectives are being attained or not. Thus, it is assumed that the existing_conditions that lead_to_successful accomplishment of certain objectives can be identified as strengths, while the conditions preventing the attainment of other objectives might represent weaknesses. The research_design is mainly quantitative, using a survey_instrument administered to school_teachers in Uganda. The survey also contains a group of qualitative questions, asking participants to include any additional personal insights. Thus the project can be better described as a mixed-methods research design. The study uses mainly primary sources, represented by the input from school_teachers in Uganda, which are carefully assessed in relation with information found through the review of literature in both primary_and_secondary sources. The data_analysis performed in SPSS looks at multiple variables, both descriptively and inferentially. In addition, the qualitative input is examined, integrating the findings with those resulting from the quantitative_analysis in order_to_formulate valid_conclusions leading to useful, practical recommendations. The interpretations of both quantitative_and_qualitative_findings are constantly related to the information and theoretical frameworks provided by reliable sources, presented_and_discussed in the review of literature. Considering its primary goal, this project_represents an evaluation research, conducted in the local settings and addressing local issues of concern. Interdisciplinary connections among historical, sociological, cultural_and_political_perspectives help reach a deeper_understanding of identified critical issues. The conclusions_and_recommendations of this research may be used as valuable resources for future political initiatives aiming to improve_the_quality_of_education in Uganda, and potentially in other developing_countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.

43671,"Much of the dialogue regarding the 21st century-corporation focuses on the increasing diversity of the U.S. labor_force and globalization of the U.S. economy (Johnston and Packer, 1987). Scholars and managers have devoted increased_attention to exploring the influences of such diversity on organizational_life (Jehn, Northcraft and Neale, 1999; O'Reilly, Williams and Barsade, 1998). The majority of this literature utilizes a top-down approach_to_managing diversity, by focusing on how organizational_leadership can maximize_the_benefits_and_minimize the challenges of diversity among its employees and constituents (Cox, 1993; Cox and Beale, 1997). Considerably less literature addresses the bottom-up tactics that employees utilize to effectively work with the diversity that they must encounter_on_a_daily_basis in their work environment. In particular, little research_explores how individuals proactively implement strategies for establishing favorable reputations among colleagues and clients_from_diverse backgrounds. The current dissertation_elucidates the process_of_social identity-based impression management, through which individuals present themselves to colleagues and clients in ways_that_strategically display their social identities, dispel_negative_stereotypes and project images of professionalism. This study integrates theories of social_identity and impression_management to explain how and why individuals attempt_to_systematically influence the image others have of them as members of their social_identity groups. The dissertation_presents_a_conceptual_framework for this process_of_social identity-based impression management, and then tests a series_of_propositions regarding the antecedents_and_consequences of this social identity-based impression_management process. Findings from this survey_study of 262 Black_American physicians reveal that racial identity, professional identity, and organizational_climate are related to whether medical_students claim or suppress a stereotyped identity during interactions with colleagues. Findings also suggest that claiming, educating and advocating for one's social_identity group is positively_related_to_psychological well-being and career satisfaction. The theoretical_contributions_and_applied implications of the conceptual_framework for social identity-based impression_management are discussed."
45649,"This thesis_seeks to begin a preliminary_analysis of the current discourse_surrounding religion and social work. In the significant literature on the subject, the authors often compared what they perceived as the oppression of religious_people in the profession_of_social_work to the oppression of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) people in the larger society. Religion was defined_in_a_very_specific_way_and_that_the_term ""religion"" was used as a proxy for ""Christianity."" The use of ""religion"" as a proxy for ""Christianity"" was quite restrictive on its own, but the definition of Christianity given by the authors of the texts was so narrow as to exclude many who might self-identify as Christians. In constructing a particular vision of what it means to be Christian, the authors also begin to construct the tone of the dialog within the profession regarding Christianity and social work. The construction that was created included a great_deal of adherence to conservative_political_ideals and antipathy towards LGBT people. The thesis_addresses the way in which a hegemonic group--Christians--was claiming to be oppressed by gays and lesbians, a group which is often considered to be an oppressed and at-risk. It also analyzes the language used by the authors of the texts to examine their assumptions about the power_dynamics at work in society and in the social_work profession. This analysis is important to the profession_of_social_work as more interest in religion and its affect on social_work_values increases."
33526,"The purpose_of_this_research is to explore_issues_of_representation as they relate specifically to the process of stereotyping. The aim is to compare two sites of enculturation into stereotype: folklore_and_popular culture. Contemporary Americans share_information and experience through folk_forms and as a result of the popular_culture they have consumed. As elements and processes of culture, both folk_and_popular_forms affect individual_and_collective behavior. My focus is on the powerful effects of creating new cultural experiences and meanings while remaining grounded_in_traditional_ways of expressing experience and meaning. This research centers on folk_and_popular images of American Indians in the United States. The theoretical frameworks for understanding the nexus of folk_and_popular_forms are cultural landscapes, landscapes of power, ethnohistory, and ethnic interaction. As such, the concept of the American_frontier becomes central_to_understanding the perpetuation of stereotypes_of_American Indians. To better illuminate an American_ethos of ethnic_interaction it is useful to examine the endless permutations_and_combinations of ideology and the image available on the cultural_landscape of ethnicity. Specifically, this project_explores_the_ways in which ethnic jokes permeate_American_culture and serve to express culturally_embedded beliefs. Additionally, this project_examines cinematic contributions to stereotyped images of American Indians to conclude that there are important historical, cultural_and_social reasons that specific images of native people in the US persist."

The modeling_framework in question blends system_dynamics with sociology, social psychology and small_group research--through a group decision-support framework denominated decision conferencing. The objective of the intervention was to create a management flight_simulator to assist front-line managers in thinking through welfare reform. This research reflects upon the case to derive grounded_theory upon which to base recommendations for better group-modeling practice. This dissertation contains three independent but linked essays. The first essay provides an overview of the intervention, and reports how group model_building was used to consider the implications of welfare reform. In accordance with system_dynamics tradition, this report focuses upon the models elicited, built, simulated, tested and extensively used throughout the intervention. The essay contains an account of key policy-related lessons, and limitations of the model-based analysis. The second essay_traces the genealogy of group model_building and explores a research theme. It focuses upon the tension between modeling as a representation of reality, and modeling as a tool for negotiating a social_order within the client group. A description of the group-modeling framework is developed to fit an ideal-type conceptual dichotomy. The essay_offers supporting_evidence to the thesis that group model_building_strives both to create_a_shared_understanding of an interpersonal or inter-organizational problem, in the form of a ""boundary-object"" model, and to build a ""micro-world"" type model that is useful in terms of policy_evaluation and design. In the third essay I carry_out_a_detailed_analysis of a portion of the case to bring each perspective to life and to provide illustrations. I propose_ways_to_identify and characterize tensions, and I report results from applying these instruments_and_procedures in the analysis_of_documents from the intervention. The dual objectives of group model_building studies establish a creative tension. In this dissertation, I propose that this tension needs to be recognized and handled_adequately to accomplish both objectives simultaneously. This research makes existing methodological tensions explicit, and calls for solutions for reconciliation."
53793,"This study examines continuity_of_care for the seriously and persistently mentally ill at a psychiatric_hospital continuum of care. Continuity of care is defined as a process involving the orderly, uninterrupted movement of clients among the diverse elements of a service_delivery_system (Bachrach 1981). A continuum is defined as the elements which comprise the system. The study_attempts to gain some understanding of the continuum_of_care at a psychiatric hospital. Utilizing four indices of continuity, it attempts to measure_the_degree to which these indices, related to four corresponding elements of an ideal typology, are present in this continuum. These indices and elements are: Client movement or lack of movement in accordance_with_treatment needs (Continuity of treatment); stability of client-provider relationship (Continuity of relationship); written_and_verbal_communication exists among the providers (Communication of Information); and efforts to locate and bring_back clients who appear to be lost in the system (Discontinuity of treatment). A moving sample of 60 seriously and persistently mentally_ill_clients is followed as they move from one service site to another along the continuum of care. Study findings may have programmatic_implications for managed_behavioral_health_care_service_delivery systems."
9857,"This study compares and analyzes nursing tasks in hospital_inpatient settings, tracing the technical changes in work over a thirty year period. The first time period, the 1950s, was an era of low specialization in medicine along with little differentiation of hospital work. It is compared with the second era, the 1980s, when medicine had become highly specialized and hospital work had undergone a higher_degree of differentiation. Work technology here is the independent variable, and the organizational_structure of nursing, conducted on an inpatient unit level, is the dependent variable. Structure is meant to include the ways in which nurses assign and complete their work. The comparison of 1950s' and 1980s' nurses' work indicates that differences in actual amounts of time nurses spend at the bedside are minimal; yet the composition or nature of such tasks today is markedly different. The ""curing"" function of nursing (i.e., assessment, medications, treatments, and procedures) is very evident in 1980s nursing. The traditional ""caring"" function of nursing (e.g., feeding and bathing patients) still remains visible but today represents a smaller part of nursing's bedside work. The most dramatic_change in nurses' work surfaced in the category of indirect work--work done in support of bedside activities. The percent of a nurse's indirect work_time_spent on patient-centered tasks (i.e., paperwork and communication) shot up from 19% in 1952 to 45% in 1983. Change in nursing technology has also led to organizational structural change. This study_concludes that these changes have been caused by a need for nurses to assume the role of ""integrator"" or coordinator whereby the modern nurse distinctively coordinates the many health_professionals and technicians practicing at the patient's bedside. The study should assist the modern_medical_establishment to clarify, and perhaps ""institutionalize"", this implicit and unique--but insufficiently recognized--nurse role."

36111,"This research_examines factors_involved in the emergence of Alzheimer's disease from an obscure medical diagnostic category to its current characterization as the fourth or fifth leading_cause_of_death_in_the_United States. The substantive_focus_of_this_research_is_concerned with examining the social_processes_involved in elevating biomedical and public_awareness of Alzheimer's disease. To this end, the historical_development of conceptions of dementia associated with old age are examined. Special attention is given to the emergence of medical conceptions that viewed aging as an inevitable_process of decline, and how those conceptions affected the ways particular types of scientific_evidence regarding diseases were interpreted. Factors which led_to_an_increased_emphasis on Alzheimer's disease as the category of preference to characterize particular types of neuropsychiatric problems associated with aging are also analyzed to illuminate_the_relationship between science, economics and politics within the context of governmental institutions, educational institutions, the media and private organizations. The research is also concerned with explicating links between ""micro"" and ""macro"" aspects_of_social experience. Micro actions of social_actors in interactional contexts become the opportunity to produce and/or reproduce actions that sustain and/or change macro_social structure. The intersection of micro_and_macro_levels_of_social experience always occurs: (1) in micro interactional situations; (2) within the context of already-determined events that provide_a_foundation for the production of social realities; and (3) within the context of undetermined events that are shape in the processes of reality construction. The phenomenon of Alzheimer's disease is used as the empirical referent to elucidate how specific marco knowledge_structures come to gain ascendancy and contribute to the organized display of the micro activities of knowledge_production in interactional processes of reality construction. The research_illustrates that the structuring of experience during micro interactional processes fundamentally forms the foundation of macro_social_structure and, paradoxically, that macro_social_structure forms the incipient and a priori foundation for any specific micro situation."
46742,"The purpose_of_this_study_was_to_examine_the_extent to which the intent of PL 94-142 for the provision_of_social_work_services_in_schools was implemented_in_Pennsylvania at the Intermediate_Unit level of school organization. PL 94-142 legislates the school_as_the_agency_in_the_community responsible for the development and coordination of a child-centered comprehensive free appropriate education for handicapped children. Parents were to be relieved_of_the_burden of suing for the rights of their individual child. Social work services in schools are defined in the regulations as related services; an integral_component of a free appropriate education for handicapped_children needing them to benefit from special education. The definition_of_the_role_and_function of the professional in the Pennsylvania_Department_of_Education certified as a home and school visitor/school social worker is congruent with the tasks to be performed as social_work_services in schools. This has not been interpreted to educational administrators throughout the State. This is further complicated by the discretion the regulations allow states_and_local_school_districts in selecting_qualified service providers. The issues arising from the ambiguous definition of qualified service_providers are that priority will be given to the maintenance needs of the organization at the expense of the service goals_of_the_legislation and that this in turn will result in a shift from a child-centered system of services to one that is task-centered. The study is presented in three parts. The first is a review_of_the_literature_describing the variables in implementation and providing the foundation_for_the_development_of_a_conceptual_model for the study. In the second part, an analysis of federal, state_and_local_policy_documents is made_to_determine the intent of PL 94-142 and how it was communicated between the several levels of government. Policy implementors were interviewed at these levels_of_government for data to describe their perceptions of the mandates for implementation and the sources of impediments. In the third part_data_from_questionnaires_collected from 83 service_providers were analyzed to describe who provides social_work services; the services provided; the extent to which educational_preparation and/or certification influences service delivery; and the extent to which services are consistent with the mandates of the Act. The interviews_were_held January - April 1979. The interviews with policy_implementors took place in face-to-face contacts or via telephone. Questionnaires were mailed to the service providers. A schedule was designed for each of the respondent groups. The sample of Special Education Directors and 83 service_providers was formed from the random_sample of 12 IUs chosen for the study. The findings: (1) modify the conceptual_model for the study; (2) affirm the need to: (a) insure the integrity of communication; (b) assure the consensus of perception of the implementors; (c) redesign the review_process to support the service goals of the legislation; (d) define who is qualified_to_provide social_work_services_in_schools to insure a child-centered system of services; and (e) insure compliance with the mandate that schools relieve parents of the burden of suing for the rights for their individual child; and (f) insure the adequate_provision_of_funds for services if they are not to be diverted from mainstream children."

Additionally, individuals outside the romantic relationship reported on student-participants' general communicator style. The research proposed that general style reports would be predictive of relational_maintenance strategy_usage and of romantic partners' relational satisfaction. The study_found_that_general style_behaviors may not be indicative of relational_maintenance strategy_usage or romantic partners' relational satisfaction. Tests of sex_differences_revealed that females' expression of various relational_maintenance_strategies and style_behaviors are associated with male partners' relational satisfaction; however, no results were obtained indicating specific_behaviors expressed by males result in female partners' relational satisfaction."
7369,"The research_presented_in_this_dissertation is a preliminary_attempt_to_understand how several important socio-economic and cultural_themes operate in parental_choice_of_care_arrangements for their school-age children, with a primary_focus on self/sibling care and its relationship to various adult_care modes. The study_draws upon data from two large studies which described child_care_arrangements for children aged 6-12. Analyses were based on 1,650 working parents surveyed in Portland, Oregon during 1983 and 1,132 working_mothers from the National Child Care Study 1990 (NCCS). This analysis_was_undertaken_to_develop comprehensive profiles of the non-school care used for children while their parents were at work, and to identify_factors which influenced parental_choice_of_care_for_children of different ages in different types of families. Five key_questions_centered on care arrangements, family_composition and employment: (1) What types of arrangements_were_used_for_the_care_of_children at each age from 6-12 years; (2) how were different modes of care distributed among families with differing adult characteristics; (3) how was the distribution of children in a family related to the patterning of care; (4) How did characteristics of employment relate to self and sibling care; and (5) what were the broad_patterns of congruence between the local_and_national studies? Data from the 1983 Portland survey were used to construct_a_comprehensive_set of appropriate variables, develop detailed profiles of self/sibling and adult_care_arrangements in the local site, and establish hypotheses to be examined in the national data. The NCCS 1990 data were then analyzed to explore whether patterns identified in the Portland data would also appear in a more recent, nationally generalizable sample. Additional variables from the NCCS were also examined to provide a larger_context for the understanding of self and sibling care."
3572,"This study analyzed the mother-child relationship within a non-clinical sample of low_socioeconomic status, Dominican_and_Puerto_Rican mother-child dyads. The study_examined_the_effects of stress, social support, maternal perception of the child's temperament, and attachment_behaviors on dyadic competence for 23 dyads. Variables assessed shortly following the child's birth during the perinatal period, and at the child's age of 12 and 18 months, were used as predictors of dyadic competence in mother-child interaction during a free-play episode observed at the child's age of 18 months. The methodology_included nonstandard, semi-structured stress and social_support scales developed for a prior study on multi-risk mothers (Fiks, Johnson and Rosen, 1985). The stress scale measured the reported level_of_stress_experienced in the areas of finances, living arrangements, children, family and friends. The size_of_the_social_support_network was based_on_the_number_of_individuals counted on by the mother, and available to help with financial, personal, and health/medical problems. The mothers' perception of her child's temperament was based on questions regarding the consistency of the child's eating_and_sleeping habits, activities enjoyed by the child, the degree of fussiness and ease of comforting the child. Attachment behaviors (proximity- and contact-seeking, contact-maintaining, resistant, and avoidant behavior) and the amount of crying were assessed during two reunion_episodes of a modified Strange_Situation_procedure at 12 months based on a 7-point dimensional rating scale (Ainsworth, Bell, Waters, and Wall, 1978). At the child's age of 18 months, the degree_of_mutual competence in dyadic_interaction was measured by the Parent-Child Observation Guide (Bernstein, Percansky, and Hans, 1987). This scale is based on Goldberg's (1977) concept of mutual competence and rates behaviors of the mother and child that support or encourage mastery of developmental tasks. Maternal perception of the child as fussing alot at 18 months was highly predictive of less effective maternal_competence in a free_play situation. This dynamic_relationship_was_stronger than that between maternal_competence and stress, social_support_and_attachment_behaviors assessed at 12 and 18 months. However, stress from living_arrangements and problems with friends_and_family during the perinatal_period were predictive of maternal competence. The relationship_between_social support, rates of proximity_seeking and contact maintenance_behaviors and maternal_competence failed_to_yield_significant results. Although the mother and child's rates of competence were not concordant, it was found that mothers who had accurate expectations of the child for the child's age, who treated the child with respect, who helped the child stay interested in a toy or activity, and remained patient with the child had higher_rates of maternal competence. For the child, rates of competence were most correlated with their ability to invite an interaction or play activity with the mother, and noticing their mothers smiling at them in several situations. In addition, high_rates of proximity_seeking_behavior during the first reunion episode was a strong_predictor of the child's competence."
43668,"This dissertation_draws on methods and theories from psychological and linguistic_anthropology to examine the social, religious, and linguistic relationships between the high-status Muslim Swahili and the disenfranchized Giriama who live in the town of Malindi on the Kenya coast. For centuries, Swahili and Giriama lived in interdependent patron-client relationships, and the Swahili group was notoriously permeable to Giriama. Over the last century, however, socioeconomic_and_political developments have calcified the divide between them, to the point that some Swahili and Giriama consider the groups not only different but deeply, essentially different. This shift has affected Swahili and Giriama notions of religion and language. Both groups tend_to_treat religions and ethnicities as though they are intrinsically yoked together (Islam with ""Swahiliness"" and the traditional Giriama religion with ""Giriamaness""). This conceptual tendency makes it increasingly_difficult for Giriama converts to be accepted as Muslims by the high-status ethnic Muslim community. Giriama have developed a ritual strategy to accommodate this change. Rather than committing their identities to Islam, Giriama instead believe that both Islam and Giriama Traditionalism are discrete sources of power, and draw on both of them in their divining and healing rituals. This maneuver is different from the ""syncretism"" usually described by ethnographers, for it does not strive to harmonize the two separate_loci of supernatural_power into a coherent cosmological system. Giriama also reflect this conceptual_shift in encounters with coercive Muslim spirits, who routinely possess Giriama individuals, making them vomit their traditional Giriama foods and besieging them with other illnesses if they partake of traditional Giriama practices. I contend that these somatic encounters with Islam are partially motivated_by_the_fact that Giriama construe Giriama ethnicity as essentially incompatible with, and hence toxic to, Islam. Finally, I describe how Giriama and Swahili conceptualize language as essentially linked to ethnicity. I delineate nine forms of linguistic essentialism on the coast, and explore some ramifications of these for ethnic_relations and for supernatural practices like divination that draw on essentially construed Other languages."
60,"This dissertation hypothesizes a psychological and economic_model_of_voting behavior. The model posits that party_identification (an implicit psychological model) and spatial voter_choice (an implicit economic model) can predict straight ticket, split ticket, single ticket, and nonvoting. The psychological_theory is represented by a party_identification model. The economic_theory is represented by the Downsian model_of_spatial voter choice, and a model_of_spatial candidate_choice introduced in this model. Moreover, this dissertation hypothesizes that both theories represent a more complete model and is statistically different from the varying models of party_identification and spatial voter choice. The parameters of the party_identification and spatial voter_choice coefficients are estimated by a logit_model utilizing American_National_Election Series survey_data from 1984. Results_indicated_that_the_full_model significantly differs from each individual model. The implications are that voting and nonvoting decisions are viewed as a process representing a current tally of evaluations of psychological and spatial voter_choice variables."
34904,"The Life Satisfaction Battery (LSB) was used with 445 participants to examine_differences in subjective well-being among three groups of Japanese_adults_living_temporarily in the United States, but who ultimately would return to Japan: those who, if given a choice, would stay_in_the_United_States (198 participants); those who would return to Japan (92); and those who were undecided (155). Participants were from Japanese families sent to the U.S. by a company or the government. Participants had comparable family situations and secure salaries and were assured return to Japan. The conclusions were based on analysis_of_quantitative_data and 35 follow-up interviews. Twelve indices were assessed to determine change between 1987 and 1995 in level of life_satisfaction among subpopulations of the participants and to determine why some wished to stay in the U.S. and some wished to return to Japan. Those who preferred_to_stay were the most satisfied overall: Freedom, feeling challenged, and greater personal_development were factors. They also felt more confident about their English_language abilities. Those who preferred to return to Japan were the least satisfied: Isolation from the extended_family and such negatives in the U.S. as crime outweighed the positive. Satisfaction of those who were undecided was between that of the other two groups. Correlations between measures_of_satisfaction and other LSB variables were high: Those who preferred_to_stay in the U.S. scored_consistently higher, and those who preferred to return scored_consistently lower. Measures of satisfaction_correlated_moderately with perceived self-competence. Japanese who preferred_to_stay scored_significantly_higher on satisfaction, competence and other positive LSB scales; those who preferred to return scored_higher on the negative LSB scales. Those who preferred to remain seemed willing to make the foreign_culture part of their lives, while those who preferred to return missed their own culture. Among gender-based differences were competence in daily_life_skills (higher among men) and motivation to make_sacrifices in order_to_achieve goals (higher among women). The results_validate the LSB for measuring life satisfaction. No counter-intuitive associations or correlations were found. vskip9pt"
22506,"This dissertation_develops models to represent alternative lending_technologies and the resulting loan_contracts_when_the_lender simultaneously faces moral_hazard_and_adverse_selection in markets where collateral is scarce. These models are used to predict who gets loans and in what conditions, when the lender must overcome collateral imperfections, high fixed costs, and increasing competition from lenders offering different contracts. The model_correctly_predicts borrower types for two Bolivian microfinance organizations. Access to credit for the poor has dramatically_improved in Bolivia due to new microlending technologies that significantly differ from collateral-based technologies and among themselves. A benchmark_model_is_developed to compare technologies when lenders simultaneously_address information asymmetries about actions (diligence) and type (productivity). Depending on the lender's stock of information and lending technology and the borrower's collateral, different contracts are offered that match different borrower classes. Comparative statics results about imperfect collateral, equity contributions, and fixed and monitoring_costs are examined. Both portfolio quality and size matter, because microlenders must cover substantial fixed handling_costs_related to lending to the poor. A tradeoff emerges as the interest_rate increases, augmenting individual repayment promises, but the total_number of borrowers and portfolio quality decline. The different technologies of the two largest Bolivian microfinance organizations, BancoSol and Caja Los Andes, are studied. An important_difference_is_the_degree of standardization of loan contracts. Andes offers personalized (separating) contracts after intensive screening, pledging of imperfect collateral (assets with high consumption but low resale value), and monitoring to ameliorate moral hazard. BancoSol offers standardized (pooling) contracts to all takers and screening_and_monitoring are delegated to joint_liability credit groups. Matching is determined by the lending technology. Low-productivity borrowers prefer standard contracts due_to_the_possibility of cross-subsidization. High-productivity borrowers prefer personalized contracts to avoid cross-subsidizing others. Competition may improve_access_for_the_poor through lower monopoly_rents but it may deteriorate the quality and, size of the portfolio of poverty-oriented lenders. Non-parametric statistics show that lower-productivity and poorer borrowers are more likely to borrow from BancoSol."
30378,"Social movement participants define themselves and their movements historically although current social_movement_theory tends to ignore this phenomenon This study_explores how and why social_movement participants reconstruct the past as a part of their movement and how this reconstructed history, or counterpast, stands_in_opposition to the official_history constructed by the dominant_group in society. Specifically, the study_relies on George_Herbert Mead's theory of time in seeking to understand how the Frente Sandinista de Liberaci&oacute;n Nacional reconstructed Nicaraguan_history and the historical figure of General Augusto C&eacute;sar Sandino in order to drive their revolution against the Somoza_regime in the 1960s and 1970s. A feature of that reconstruction is that the Sandinistas attributed posthumous charisma (a variation of Max Weber's concept of charisma) to Sandino. Four constructions of history are explored--those by Sandino himself and his supporters, by North Americans, by Anastasio_Somoza and his supporters, and finally, the contemporary Sandinista reconstruction of the past presented in the revolution that was victorious in 1979.

The major_focus was on the correlation between student_involvement and social_adjustment as they relate to Black_students on a predominantly White campus. A statistical program for the social sciences (SPSS-X) was utilized_to_analyze eleven research_questions which were grouped under the following three broad questions: (1) What is the nature_of_the_relationship between involvement, social adjustment, and academic_achievement for Black undergraduates? (2) What are the effects of selective Black student_characteristics on the measures of involvement, social adjustment, and academic achievement? (3) What are the effects of the racial_composition of clubs_and_organizations on the measures of involvement, social adjustment, and academic_achievement after controlling_for_socioeconomic_status and commitment? The data supported the following assumptions: that there is a positive_relationship_between_student_involvement and social adjustment; and that one's commitment_to_college has a significant_effect on one's level of social_adjustment and involvement. The data, however, did not support assumptions regarding academic achievement, gender differences, academic_college of enrollment, and socioeconomic status. There was no intercorrelation between academic_achievement and measures of involvement and social adjustment. The findings suggested that social_adjustment may be affected by the racial_composition of the clubs_and_organizations students become involved in.

16232,"This study_investigated parents' beliefs as these relate to racism, sexism, and childrearing. The research examined: (a) parents' perceptions of influences on their beliefs about racism_and_sexism and the relative_influence of their own mothers_and_fathers in this regard, (b) the influences of age, gender, and education on racism and sexism, (c) whether parents teach their children about race ideology, (d) the relationship between parents' past_and_present contact with other races and race egalitarianism, (e) the relationships among racism, sexism social_dominance_orientation and parenting style, i.e., restrictiveness or nurturance, and (f) parental_ethnotheories and cultural_themes regarding racism and sexism. A semi-structured interview, a card sort, and numerous questionnaires were employed to address these concerns. Twenty-one, White_American_parents participated. Most of the parents were married, Protestant, and middle to upper-middle class; however, there was considerable_heterogeneity in the sample concerning the ages of the parents and their children, where the parents were raised, and their experiences and backgrounds.

48710,"The purpose_of_this_research_was_to_examine_the_relationship_between_trauma_symptoms in war veterans, secondary_trauma_symptoms in their spouses, and secondary_trauma_symptoms in their children. Up to 17% of combat_veterans_returning from the wars_in_Iraq_and_Afghanistan have exhibited symptoms of post-traumatic stress_disorder (PTSD) (Hoge et al., 2005). Living with and caring for those with PTSD has lead to secondary_trauma_symptoms in family_members (Figley, 1998). Past_research_has_found that trauma_symptoms in veterans have had an impact on the family system of the veteran including their spouse (Dekel, Goldblatt, Keidar, Solomon, Polliack, 2005; Dirkzwager, Bramensen, Ader, & van_der Ploeg, 2005), and their children (Del Valle & Avelo, 1996; Rosenheck & Nathan, 1985). A conceptual_model and theoretical_framework_based on a review_of_the_literature suggested that spousal secondary_trauma_symptoms have a mediating_effect_on_the_relationship between soldier PTSD_symptoms_and_child secondary_trauma_symptoms by increasing these symptoms in children. The population studied included Soldiers attached to a Midwestern National_Guard_unit and their spouses. A survey was designed based on the Total_Design_Method (Dillman, 1978) using the PTSD_Checklist (Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993), the Secondary Trauma Scale (Motta, Newman, Lambardo, and Silverman, 2004), and the Child_Behavior_Checklist (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001) to measure stress_symptoms in families. A cross-sectional sample of Soldiers assigned to a National_Guard_unit and their spouses was surveyed. The survey_results_suggest that immediate family_members of combat_veterans with high_levels_of_PTSD are at risk for developing secondary_traumatic_stress and that secondary_trauma_symptoms in spouses of combat_veterans are a risk-increasing mediating variable between trauma_symptoms in combat_veterans and secondary_trauma_symptoms in their children. Due to a very low_response_rate and small_sample size, these results should be interpreted cautiously."
29566,"Ninety four newly_married_couples in central_Pennsylvania were interviewed within three months of marriage, and again each year for the next two years. The dependent_variables were marital_satisfaction at each of these three points in time. During the first phase of data gathering, spouses_reported the extent_to_which_they_felt_pressure to marry or not to marry by their fathers or mothers. At each of the next two phases they reported the extent to which each parent's opinion of them mattered to them; frequency_of_contact_with_parents following marriage; and the extent to which each spouse talked to each parent about feelings, problems, or personal_matters during the past two months. Hierarchical_multiple_regression_analyses_were_performed_to_determine_the_relationship_between_parental_involvement and marital satisfaction. Pressure to marry from husbands' fathers could predict_subsequent marital dissatisfaction. Trends were found connecting husbands' high_involvement with their mothers and wives' low involvement with their fathers with marital dissatisfaction. Two sample t-tests were calculated_to_determine_differences_in_parental involvement between happy_and_unhappy spouses. Happy spouses were those who had a balance in their relationships with their parents, neither being too involved nor too distant. Husbands who were the least satisfied_with_their_marriages were those who felt_pressure to marry from their fathers, or who had contact with mothers more than twice a week and confided in them more than moderate amount. Unhappy wives felt their fathers' opinion of them mattered only a moderate amount, and talked_with_their_fathers about personal_matters only a little. Unhappy spouses had more extreme_scores than happier spouses, in that they experienced more high_and_low_levels of involvement with parents. Unhappy husbands had wives who had low involvement with their fathers, while unhappy wives had husbands who had high_involvement with their mothers.

Intensive interviews_were_held to gather_information on the importance of the family for the institutionalized elderly, to identify_patterns of association, and to identify the nature of interaction which takes_place between the institutionalized_elderly and their family. Among the findings in this study was the dysfunctional communications which exist between the elderly resident and their family members. Elderly residents were found to feel_misunderstood by their family but as a rule did not make their feelings known. Instead, most tended to be compliant and accepting of their fate. Family members, on the other hand, felt less internal conflict if their elderly member appeared to be adjusting to the nursing_home placement. Contact of family_members with the resident who lived alone prior_to_placement was as or more frequent since placement. Three levels of family_involvement were identified based on the nature and quality of resident-family interaction. These patterns were designated detached, involved, and committed according to the intensity and extensiveness of the family's interaction with the resident. Residents with cognitive_deficits that limited their ability_to_make their needs known tended to have a larger_proportion of committed family members. Family members generally did not get involved with the institution on behalf of their elderly. Relief from direct_care which family_members_experienced with placement did not appear to improve family relations. Instead, family_members_tended to follow previously_established relational patterns, although patterns of association--i.e., visiting frequency, shared activities, etc.--may have changed since nursing_home placement. It is suggested that nursing homes adopt_policies_designed_to_promote resident-family communication and understanding."
50305,"This dissertation_is_a_comparative_study_of_the_historical_development of the state in the three leading coffee_producing_countries of Central America: Guatemala, El_Salvador and Costa Rica. It focuses_explicitly upon the historical impact of the development of coffee_cultivation upon agrarian politics and the process_of_state_formation in those countries. It traces_the_emergence of the coffee_industry and of the region's modern_political systems, in an effort_to_determine to what extent the divergent_patterns of modern_political_development in Central_America were related to structual differences in the leading_export sector. This research_suggests that Central_American development has been influenced by the historical interaction between a set of regionally_distinctive_geographic_factors and international_economic conditions. Class relations and industrial arrangements inherited_from_the_colonial_era conditioned the development of export_agriculture in the nineteenth century. A two-stage historical model of these interactions is presented. Two broadly different national experiences were associated with the advent of coffee cultivation. In Guatemala and El Salvador, where the inital expansion of coffee was blocked by landholding villages and surviving colonial institutions, export_agriculture was associated with serious agrarian_conflict and the development of authoritarian_political systems. In Costa Rica, coffee_production began early, expanded gradually, and was not associated with serious agrarian conflict. Cross-national differences in the relative value of land_and_labor subsequently_led to regional_variation in patterns_of_land use and tenure, the organization of labor markets, and the economic_position of elites and peasants. These factors account_for_regional_differences_in_patterns of class_conflict during the period of worldwide overproduction and price_instability which culminated in the depression of the 1930's."
347,"Black megachurches, with weekly_church_attendance figures of 2,000 or more participants and activities seven days a week, have the ability_to_provide numerous social services in the form of volunteers, financial resources, and support networks. These churches, among the largest institutions in the Black community, raise several questions_and_issues_of_interest about their potential social impact. Secondary data_analysis from the Faith Factor 2000 database of Black churches (n = 1,863) and linear_regression modeling are used to study the effect church size (in particular, the Black megachurch) has on social_service_delivery in the Black community and what church dynamics motivate social_service involvement. An important_aspect of this debate_involves the dual_role of the Black church as both a spiritual_and_social institution. The theories of several sociologists including, Karl_Marx (1964), Emile_Durkheim (1915), W.E.B. Du_Bois (1903) and more recently, Lincoln and Mamiya (1990) address this dichotomy. Employing the theoretical_framework and methods developed by Barnes (2004), this study_closely_examines_the_social_service activities of churches of different sizes--particularly, the Black megachurches--and how those activities affect the overall social_service activities of the Black community. Results show that Megachurches offer more types of social_service activities than smaller sized churches but, the number of social_service_programs they offer do not statistically differ. Additionally, churches in good financial health, with better-educated, paid clergy positively influence social_service sponsorship. While variables associated with a prophetic function have a greater_influence on social service, variables that reflect a priestly function, specifically whether churches sponsor religious programs, are also important in motivating churches to provide social services. This study_adds_to_the_growing_literature_on_Black megachurches by providing evidence of church size_effect on the character and extent of social_service_delivery by Black churches to Black communities. It also explores the factors that lead Black churches to take part in social_service activities."

17156,"Over the past two decades community_foundations have begun acknowledging themselves as local_leaders and looking to place-based change methods to benefit the communities they serve. Investigating how a community foundation performs these roles provides insights into the poorly-understood realm of elites in social_movement philanthropy and how intermediary social_movement_organizations mobilize others and institutionalize successes. To examine these issues and more, this dissertation asks: (1) What does community foundation-led local change and leadership encompass? (2) How prevalent is this leadership among community foundations? (3) How does a community foundation mobilize others and institutionalize change? (4) How effective are community_foundations at leading local social change? These questions are explored through combining data from case studies of three social change-focused initiatives of the East_Bay Community Foundation (EBCF) in Oakland, California with an internet survey of U.S. community foundations. The case_study_analysis is based on interviews, document review, and observation from 2002 to 2006. This research_draws_on_social_movement (notably, mechanism analysis) and institutional_theory to develop models of third-party mobilization and institutionalization. Some of the findings from the EBCF case studies reveal needed adjustments to accepted frameworks of emergent mobilization and institutionalization. These modifications include: mobilization by a community foundation proceeds along two consecutive tracks, internal and external; during the second phase of mobilization the community foundation places an emphasis on relational mechanisms; successful, sustained third party_mobilization requires a paradigm_shift on the part of the target organizations; and institutionalization of the community foundation's goals may require that the partners form a collective identity. The hybrid-elite nature of community_foundations makes them structurally and relationally well-suited to facilitate these processes. Nevertheless, the survey reveals that while nearly 90% of community_foundations participate in some form of community leadership, only 4% of the population are truly leaders with a social_change approach. Generalists by design, risk-averse by nature, community_foundations tend to shy away from true grassroots or policy engagement. The dissertation_concludes_with_implications of the findings for community_foundations interested_in_pursuing social_change work and elaborates on propositions for future academic study."
47327,"This study investigates the factors that influence the accomplishment and allocation of innovative work among distributed settings in the international software industry. Over the past 15 years, several major software_development centers have emerged in various countries. The study_uses_ethnographic_methods_of_participant_observation in a dispersed team_of_software_developers working across two locations--the West_Coast of the US and Bangalore, India--and additional interviews with managers in companies active in offshore software development. The collaboration_between_remote developers is impeded_by_the_difficulty of achieving the creative_engagement needed for work on an innovative project. Group engagement is difficult_to_achieve and to maintain because of two main reasons. First, the numerous barriers_separating the sites create a thick opacity that impedes the knowledge of work processes at the remote site. Work in the distributed setting is affected by the scarcity of the human interface, and by the absence of boundary_objects that structure intense and interactive work episodes. As a result, the development of work_routines and the emergence of processes--contagion, spontaneity, and reciprocity--that sustain engagement across sites are prevented. Furthermore, the status differential between the sites leads to the underutilization of available boundary_objects and boundary spanners. Second, the code ownership in which engagement is rooted--responsibility over work outcomes, entailing both coding and design tasks--is jealously_guarded by existing centers. The difficulty of obtaining code ownership over innovative work limits the new centers' ability_to_grow their capabilities and hence improve their status. The study_shows that it is the emotional basis to creativity that forms the micro-foundations to the dispersion of creative work. It is the difficulty of engaging in a common activity across the multiple boundaries of geography and status that explains the fact that innovativeness thrives in proximate settings. These findings_have_important_implications_for_understanding the forces that sustain agglomeration in innovation, and permit the development of capabilities in new innovative centers in the world economy."
49233,"This dissertation_investigates the relationships between middle manager roles and IT in large hierarchical organizations facing turbulent_environmental changes. In this organizational setting, traditional monitoring and reporting roles are pervasive among middle managers. The turbulent environment, however, calls for a new organizational_model and new roles for middle managers. The main_purpose_of_this_thesis_is_to_develop an IT-enabled role transformation model that provides design_guidelines for an IT infrastructure which will enable middle_managers to successfully revitalize their roles--taking on more innovative and knowledge-creating roles while reducing their traditional monitoring and reporting roles. Building on the organizational_learning literature, a model of an IT infrastructure supporting absorptive_capacity (IISAC) was constructed along three dimensions: prior_knowledge (supporting prior_information capture and retrieval), external_knowledge (supporting access to outside information) and diversity of knowledge (providing managers with information about who knows what). The relationship between the revitalized middle managers' roles and IISAC was empirically tested. A field_survey_was_conducted with 203 middle_managers in the Korean oil_refinery organizations along with interviews with 25 of their middle managers. The results showed that the IT infrastructure that is designed to support the organizational_knowledge_creation_process along the three dimensions is positively_related to middle managers' time_spent on revitalized roles, indicating that IT can enable middle_managers to transform to more innovative and knowledge-creating roles. Most interestingly, the relationship between IT and revitalized roles is significant only after a ""minimum"" level of innovative culture is reached. The threshold_effect of organizational_culture indicates that organizations need to assess_the_level of innovative culture before heavily investing in IT. The theoretical_development in this study_shows how difficult-to-innovate organizations begin_to_move toward innovative and learning-oriented organizations through the IT-enabled role transformation of middle managers. The understanding we gained_from_this_study will contribute to further development of an IT-enabled organizational_learning model."
50773,"This qualitative_inquiry_explores how people of Arab_descent_living_in_the_United_States express their collective ethnic, panethnic, religious, and national identities in talk. Twenty-one participant observations, fifty interviews, and four group_discussions_were_conducted in the greater_Seattle_area in the state_of_Washington with first- and second-generation women_and_men of Arab_descent and of Druze, Muslim, and Christian faiths. Identity labels and stories about personal experiences were identified as two means_of_communication used to express collective identities. The first part_of_the_study_explores the situated uses and themes_related to sixteen identity labels, such as Arab, Arab American, Christian, Muslim, or Egyptian through grounded_theory and the ethnography of speaking. Self-identification as Arab, Arab American, Muslim, or Syrian depended on such situational_factors as audience, physical setting, purpose, and topic of the interaction. While some respondents dropped the label Arab after September 11 to avoid discrimination, others started to self-identify as Arab_American after September 11. The second part_of_the_study is a narrative_analysis of how the participants reported, performed, and evaluated what it means to identify as Arab, Arab American, Muslim, Druze, Palestinian, Iraqi, or Lebanese. For some participants, being Arab related_to_social practices, such as ways of speaking, or to ethical dilemmas, such as participating in the Gulf_War as an American of Arab descent. The participants in this study identified themselves as a heterogeneous_group with intersecting and evolving collective identities that were affirmed and refuted in social interactions (e.g., more than half of the first-generation participants did not identify as Arab_American due to not having been socialized in the U.S. or not wanting to be regarded as a minority). The study_adds_to_the_literature concerning communication, culture, and identity by illustrating how collective identities are constructed_and_expressed in social interaction. The study_shows that collective_identity expression is situated, collective identities can become salient in interactions in which value systems are questioned, collective identification can impact social interactions, and that the expression of Arab collective identities changed after September 11."
22658,"Juvenile offending has been a nationally_recognized persistent social problem. Current interventions are still distant from comprehensive_and_holistic resolutions in preventing and decreasing delinquent behaviors. One critical limitation of the existing intervention_strategies for decreasing juvenile_delinquency is the exclusion of religious factors. The main_purpose_of_this_dissertation_is_to_reexamine the relationship_between_religiosity and delinquency in a multivariate_context by adopting advanced research_methods and extending earlier_work with a sample from ADD Health data. Additionally, in recognition_of_the_importance of temporal_order between exogenous_variables_and_endogenous variables, exogenous_variables are chosen from the wave 1 data and endogenous_variables were taken from the wave 2 data for the present study. The use of two wave data greatly reduces the threat of spuriousness. As the theoretical_framework of the present study, the social_control_theory is elaborated upon by incorporating the basic concept of delinquent_peer_influence from the differential_association theory. Utilizing the structural_equation model (SEM), the theoretical_model examines both the direct effects of adolescent religious belief and its indirect effect through other intervening_factors_from_social_control_theory and differential_association theory. Also, based_on_previous_studies that the effects_of_religiosity vary across different types of delinquent behavior, the study examines the effect of religiosity separately for minor_offenses and serious offenses. The results indicate that adolescent_religiosity has a statistically_significant direct_and_independent_effect on serious delinquent behaviors. Yet the results are somewhat different for minor offenses. The persistent and significant_effect of adolescent_religiosity on family, peers, and schools provides support that the effect of religious belief on delinquency can be extensive in deterring delinquent behaviors through these non-religious factors. The implications of the results for theory and future_research are discussed, along with limitations of the analysis. Furthermore, implications_for_social_work_practice_and_policy are examined in greater detail, albeit not exhaustively, because the integration of religious factors into social_service provisions can be challenging_due to constitutional concerns_related to the separation between Church and State."
23808,"Recognizing the considerable risk of suicidal_behavior experienced by the adolescent population, the significant_impact_of_suicide as the cause of death among adolescents, and the reported increasing rates of suicidal_behavior among minority populations, there is a growing need for social research regarding the phenomenon. The current_study_proposes that suicidal_behavior_among_adolescents_residing within areas of extreme disadvantage is a direct result of the individual's acquisition of social capital, referred to as 'social capital of the disadvantaged.' It is argued that, due_to_the_nature_and_limited 'reach' of the networks developed by teenagers, the resources_acquired and utilized further entrench the adolescent within the community and; therefore, reinforce the factors that lead to suicidal_ideation_and_suicide attempt within the population of interest. Though the results fail to provide_conclusive_support to the proposed theory, they do suggest that the individual's perception of social_support_and_social_context_have_an_important impact_on_the_incidence_of_suicidal_behavior among low-income adolescents. Further research, with more appropriate measures of social capital, should be undertaken_to_investigate whether there is any validity to the existence of a 'social capital of the disadvantaged.'

47691,"One of the basic goals of any developing country should be ""adequacy"" or ""self-sufficiency"" in food supply. This goal is vital because it is the main_channel through which persistent hunger_and_malnutrition can be reduced or overcome with appropriate governmental interventions. It is also important because of the rapidly_growing populations of developing_countries that greatly increase food demand. In most developing countries, therefore, emphasis is being increasingly accorded to food_production or food_security_programs in order for the respective nations to live up to this challenge. The purpose_of_this_study is to examine the performance of the Kenyan food_sector with a specific_focus on the country's small_farmers during a period_of_twenty_years since independence. The major_components of the study, namely, production, marketing, and consumption are examined along with related_aspects impacting on the agricultural_sector in particular and the Kenyan_economy as a whole. In connection with the above, and with the realization that small_farmers constitute the vast_majority of the country's food producers, the respective findings_and_recommendations of the study as stated in chapter six are aimed_specifically at improving food_production_capacity of this category of farmers. The cultivation_of_crops that are both economical for them to produce and which are also staples in their respective areas are preferred over predominantly commercial varieties. The specific findings of the study, however, are that Kenyan food_production has generally been declining while consumption has been increasing at a rapid_pace and also that although the government has been making_efforts to help small_farmers in the form of improved_incentives and services, these are still inadequate. The needs of the most deserving farmers (small farmers) are still not being met. In order for the goal of food_supply_security to be achieved in Kenyan, political_and_administrative_support for small_farmers throughout the country will be inevitable in the short term. In the longer term, efficient food_production in the country will probably have to be determined_by_market_forces and appropriate fiscal policies for the agricultural_sector as a whole."
49981,"This case_study is an exploration of the life of a highly productive gifted female to understand_and_describe the individual, family, and educational factors and interactions that promoted her growth. The informant selected_for_this_study was considered to be among a select group of the 11 most successful PEG graduates (as of 1992) on the basis of her exceptional academic and extra-curricular productivity, and judgments of her personal_growth by administrators of the Program for the Exceptionally Gifted (PEG) at Mary_Baldwin College. PEG is an early_entrance_college_residential_program for gifted_adolescent_females which began in 1985. Students are given the opportunity to complete their college_degree in as few as four years. Prospective students apply to PEG from their eighth_grade_year on and are accepted based upon giftedness, consistent achievement, and personal maturity. Ruby Kelp was selected as an exemplary graduate who demonstrated optimal development, was reflective, and had good_rapport with this researcher. A naturalistic, case_study_approach_provided an interactive perspective acknowledging the critical nature of context in studying such a complex subject as human growth. Theory emerged from: textual data; products selected by the graduate; and in-depth interviews and observations of Ruby, her parents, and mentors. Focus on remarkable human functioning provided an understanding of how that optimal_functioning occurred, was fostered, and developed. Rich descriptive_information_helps_explain how a gifted female was nurtured and empowered to be productive at such a young age. A family model of interdependence emerged from the evidence and focused on four themes. First, the Kelps promoted love_and_commitment in their family. Second, the Kelps promoted authenticity_and_autonomy by modeling the process of being true_to_oneself and self-governing. Third, the Kelps promoted uniqueness and purpose by forging unique identities despite norms for their culture. Fourth, the Kelps promoted interdependence and evolving purpose by working to return their gifts and make_a_difference in others' lives. Study findings affirmed and extended experts' assertions and future_directions_for_research were offered in parenting and educating gifted females."
8254,"This study_analyzes rap_music as street_culture among African Americans. The research_explores the philosophy and aesthetic_ideology of rap music; examines rap_music as a dynamic form of communication; and places rap_music within a continuum of black expression. Rap music evolved among African_American_youth of New York_City during the 1970s as a quasi-song with rhyme_and_rhythmic speech, which draws on black street language and is recited over an instrumental soundtrack. By the 1980s, rap became the most vital of the new popular musical forms. Little or no research_exists to analyze the theoretical_basis of this tradition. The present study, based_on_extensive_fieldwork executed in New York City, interprets rap_music as a complex form that is rooted in urban_black street culture. The social dynamic of street_culture gives shape and life to rap music. This study_concludes that rap_music is (1) a display of cultural_values and aesthetics; (2) an expressive form; (3) an agent for social_control_and_social cohesiveness; (4) a political forum; (5) a symbol of ethnicity; and (6) a dynamic means for socio-economic mobility in mainstream_American_culture for African_American youth."

Data was gathered from the New York_Times the Washington_Post between 1994 and 1996 on how opinions_and_beliefs about welfare recipients, the welfare system, and dependency were molded and shaped in the media by various claims-makers, including politicians, advocates, experts, bureaucrats, and welfare_recipients themselves. Qualitative content_analysis was used to examine the language, symbols and rhetoric used to explain who recipients are, why they were on welfare, and how to help (or not help) them. Quantitative analysis was also used to determine the identity and frequency of the various participants in the debate. This study_found that negative_stereotypes about welfare_recipients abound in the media, and that the voices of advocates were barely heard amidst a hyperbolic and dramatic debate_that_took_place_primarily among government officials. The social problem of welfare_dependency was constructed so as to avoid structural changes, instead focusing on solutions aimed at changing the individual rather than changing_institutional_barriers to self-sufficiency. This study points to the need for advocates and others to cultivate a more sophisticated use of the media, employing a range of rhetorical_devices and strategies to insure that they are heard in the policymaking arena."
21900,"The objective_of_this_dissertation_is_to_provide a basic analysis of the fragmentary theoretical position which emerged in the later 1970's calling itself humanistic sociology, and to formulate a more or less systematic and extended statement of the position. This task is not carried out ex nihil, but rather employs certain kinds of related orientations as auxiliary resources to this end. So stated, this dissertation adheres to the following sequence of analysis: (1) In order to be able to identify_the_basic_characteristics of an emergent humanistic_orientation and to specify other similar orientations which are of potential aid in offering a fuller statement of the humanistic orientation, a generalized analytic scheme is developed. It distinguishes the most fundamental positions on basic_questions (epistemological-methodological and social ontological) of explicit concern in sociological_theory (Chapter II). (2) Using this analytic scheme, the distinctive_features of humanistic sociological_theory are identified (Chapter III). (3) Components of the scheme are also employed_to_analyze other related orientations (e.g., Blumerian symbolic interactionism, Schutzean phenomenological sociology, critical theory, and Yugoslavian praxis marxism) as potential resources to elaborate and expand the original statement of humanistic sociological_theory (Chapters IV through VII). (4) Finally, a reformulated and expanded statement of a humanistic sociological_theory is offered (Chapter VIII)."
19475,"This study_focused_on_the_relationship_between_parental_racial_socialization_messages and the degree of racial_identity_and_psychosocial_development in Biracial individuals of African-American and Anglo-American heritages. One of the major_issues for interracial_families is the transmission of a racial/ethnic identity_and_cultural_heritage to children_and_adolescents (Gibbs, 1989). Furthermore, research demonstrated that whenever Biracial individuals are confused about their racial identity, they probably have received ambivalent messages_from_parents (Gibbs & Moskowitz-Sweet, 1991). Biracial males and females, age 18 and older were surveyed nationwide. Participants_were_asked_to_report on the extent and content of discussions in their family related to being Biracial and the impact of these discussions on their beliefs_and_attitudes about being Biracial. Biracial identity was assessed through semi-structured interviews. Racial identity was assessed through using a 23-item questionnaire that assesses three aspects of ethnic identity: (a) positive ethnic_attitudes and a sense of belonging; (b) ethnic_identity achievement; and (c) ethnic behaviors or practices. Erikson (1968) related ego_identity_development to racial identity. Adult personality development and overall psychosocial_health were assessed using a 112 item_questionnaire_based on Erikson's eight stages_of_psychosocial development. An association between type of parental_racial_socialization message and racial_identity was not found, nor was an association_between_psychosocial_adjustment and racial_identity found.

7620,"In the decades after the failed uprising of 1863, Polish activists within the Austrian, Russian_and_German empires sought_to_strengthen their stateless nation. Eschewing armed insurrection, they focused their energies on a new means of nation-building: national commemorations. Through public_celebrations of historic events and illustrious individuals, these Poles were able to transcend borders, establish a national discourse, turn peasants into nationally conscious citizens, and raise the visibility of the nation. Thanks to these celebrations, Poles were better prepared for the outcome of World_War I: a state of their own. At the same time, the commemorations facilitated a recasting, or ""reinventing,"" of Polish_national identity. For, while the nation was augmented by peasants, workers, and others newly conscious of their Polishness, other descendants of the inhabitants of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Jews) were increasingly marginalized. The multi-ethnic, multi-denominational ""noble nation""--the ""Poland"" of the pre-partition period--was transformed into a more homogeneous_ethnic community. The old ""Polish"" history became the purview of the new, ethnically Polish nation. The commemorations we discuss include the jubilee of the writer J&oacute;zef Ignacy Kraszewski in 1879; the bicentennial of the Siege of Vienna (1883); the translation of the remains of the Romantic poet Adam_Mickiewicz to Cracow (1890) as well as the erection of monuments in his honor in Warsaw and Cracow (1898); the centennials of the Constitution of 3 May 1791, the partitions, and the Kosciuszko Insurrection of 1794; celebrations of the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg) in 1410; the centennial of the Napoleonic general, Prince J&oacute;zef Poniatowski, in 1913 as well as the fiftieth_anniversary of the January Insurrection that same year. With their wealth of images, ideas, and cultural artifacts, these celebrations illuminate political, social, and cultural_dimensions of the partitioned Polish nation as well as trace its impact on and reaction to international developments. ""Reinventing Poland"" contributes_to_the_literature on nation-building and festivals as well as to Polish historiography and the history of Central/East-Central/Eastern Europe."
9518,"This study_examined_the_relationship_between_maternal_employment and children's academic_and_social adjustment. Existing research has concluded that maternal_employment_status_per_se has no differential_impact on children's development. Rather, maternal_employment is linked to child_development through a variety of mediating variables. Variables identified as potential_mediators by the maternal_employment literature--maternal work schedule, children's gender and age, parents' marital status, mothers' and fathers' occupational status, and maternal_role satisfaction--were examined in this investigation. The NASP-KSU Divorce Project provided the database for this study. Maternal employment data were available for 628 subjects at Time 1, 169 subjects at Time 2, and 58 subjects at Time 3. The dependent_measures of children's adjustment included 23 Time 1 variables (17 social, 6 academic), 31 Time 2 variables (23 social, 8 academic), and 16 Time 3 variables (11 social, 5 academic). Children's adjustment was measured at Times 1, 2, and 3 concurrently. Time 1 maternal_employment_status was also used to predict children's adjustment at Times 2 and 3. The central_focus_of_this_study_concerned the effects_of_maternal work schedule on children's adjustment. Independent samples t -tests yielded few significant_differences_in_adjustment between children of unemployed and full-time employed mothers. However, a substantial_number_of_significant_differences_were_found_favoring better adjustment for children of part-time employed, rather than full-time employed, mothers.

However, children of part-time employed_mothers demonstrated better adjustment than children of full-time employed_mothers when mothers resumed working after their children were school-age. Stepwise multiple regressions of SES_factors found parents' education levels overshadowed maternal_occupational_status in the prediction of children's adjustment. Father's occupational_status demonstrated_significant independent_variance beyond that of maternal_employment_status in predicting children's adjustment in hierarchical_regression analyses. A final series_of_stepwise regressions revealed_that_children of mothers satisfied with their life roles, particularly their parenting roles, outperformed_children of less satisfied mothers."

Participants' provision of effective support_services to peers is examined within the context of a larger_social problem, ineffective mental_health_care for people labeled ""chronically mentally ill."" My objective in this project was to ascertain_the_nature of mental_health consumerism for people_involved with this organization. Documentary, in-depth interview, and field methods_were_used_to_collect data. Qualitative analyses were used to: construct a case_study of the organization; profile participants' mental_health_treatment and organizational experiences; and identify suggestions for reforming the mental_health system. Theoretical analyses relate findings to operations of the political_economy and current mental_health_system practices. Data analyses, informed by grounded_theory methodology, reveal that the common element in experiences of mental_health_consumers is a concept I describe as a social_vulnerability state. This refers to a disturbance in self or social_identity that creates a need for a meaningful_definition of situation from others (e.g., peers or professionals). The definition_of_the_situation is a social_construction of reality, anchored in structural relations. It is affected by personal_biography and social_position of ""definer(s)"" and persons_seeking definition. Analyses reveal that substantial investment in the work of the organization allows some consumers to realize a situated empowerment and a changed sense of self. Two components_of_organizational activity emerge as features allowing changed self-definitions and/or the resolution of felt social vulnerability. One is the transformation of the organization into a supportive community for peers in the mental_health system. The second is realized within the community: in peer-to-peer interactions, consumers offer each other redefinitions of self or situation that allow them to alter insidious messages about self received in traditional mental_health treatments (e.g., ""chronically mentally ill""). Mental health consumers' embrace of new definitions is affected by their acceptance of the organization as a community; their level_of_involvement within the community; and the length_of_time participants formerly defined themselves as ""mentally ill"" persons."

Ninety-four participants in 6 states (TX, CA, MI, OH, KY, & PA) completed_a_modified_version of the Acculturation_Rating_Scale for Mexican-Americans (Cuellar, Jasso, & Harris, 1980) plus questions about work experiences, family support, and perceived effects of working outside the home. Participants working outside the home in gainful_employment were significantly_more_acculturated (independent of generation, education, and religion). However, among those who had worked outside the home, years worked did not significantly correlate with acculturation. Three possible explanations are discussed: (a) it may be that more acculturated women_choose_to_work outside the home, rather than work causing acculturation, (b) it may be that progressive acculturation was not measured because it happens too quickly (e.g., in the first year or two of work) to be detected by a correlation, or (c) the instrument measured preferences (e.g., music and food) rather than values that work_experience would be more likely to affect. Participants with more education were more acculturated when controlling for religion, but not when controlling for work location. The hypothesis that Christian participants would be more acculturated than Muslim participants (controlling for education_and_work location) was not supported, although this might have been due to difficulty_in_recruiting Muslim participants. The study is also limited in that the least acculturated women may not have been either (a) reached by recruiters or (b) allowed to participate due to restraints by husband or society. Participants working outside the home indicated that doing so had increased their self-esteem by providing independence. Raising children was the most common_reason for not working outside the home. Most participants' families would support their choice to work outside the home if they desired. Future research may include collaboration with a Muslim researcher in order to target Muslim participants. Also, the creation of an instrument to examine a broader_range of the facets of acculturation (e.g., values) should be considered."
42275,"This study_was_designed_to_investigate the environment_at_a_predominantly_White_public university, seeking to identify_factors the literature suggest have an impact on Black attrition_and_retention rates. More specifically, this study_focused_on_examining the perceptions and interactions with the institutional_environment that are believed_to_affect Black students' academic_performance and dropout_behavior at predominantly White colleges. A student-environment congruence model is used to explain_the_process of Black_student_persistence and withdrawal. Data was obtained by the use of two questionnaire instruments. The Environmental Satisfaction_Questionnaire and a specially_constructed biographical_data survey_instrument were used to obtain the perceptions of Black_undergraduate_students of their campus environment. Black_male_and_female_undergraduate_students_at_a_large_public predominantly_White_university were the respondents in the study. Two hundred_questionnaires were distributed; one hundred and thirty-three were returned completed. An ex post facto, survey_research_design was used. Investigated were: Satisfaction with minority advising, perceived_racial climate, feelings of alienation, presence of minority faculty, adequate_financial assistance. Five hypotheses were tested; two were supported by the research data. Significant differences_were_found_to_exist between the various classes, with juniors being the most dissatisfied with the environment and with their relationships with the faculty on campus than either the freshmen, sophomores, or seniors. The findings_of_this_study also revealed_that_the_majority of the sample_of_Black_undergraduate students: (1) indicated that the financial_aid was inadequate in meeting their educational costs, (2) expressed feeling alienated on campus, (3) perceived some degree of racial_hostility on campus, and (4) felt that more recruiting of Black_students_and_faculty was needed. This study concluded that increased contact with professors, and administrators on campus can create a more supportive and friendly_environment for Black students. Recommendations_include faculty_and_student_awareness workshops and suggestions to address these areas."
42418,"Recently, many college_administrators have attempted to create_a_climate on their campuses which emphasizes the importance of valuing all members_of_the_campus community, encouraging diversity of the student population, and educating those who are intolerant of diversity. As a result, many students on our college_campuses are resentful and angered by attempts to ""force feed"" them information regarding issues of diversity. Such resistance must be considered_when_planning a curriculum that emphasizes diversity education. The purpose_of_this_study_was_to_determine whether the use of an educational game lessens student resistance toward diversity education while increasing content, behavioral, and attitudinal change. Eighteen participants, a selected_group_of_college_students and facilitators, played the game for a 90-minute period, exploring racism_and_heterosexism during the playing of the game. Pre- and postgame interviews and two follow-up interviews (one week and four to six weeks later) were conducted with each participant. Participants were asked two broad questions: How did participants experience playing the game? This was based on participants' perceptions, my observations during the playing of the game, interviews, and participants' journals. Did playing_the_game influence the participants' knowledge, awareness, or actions regarding racism and heterosexism, and if so, how?"
6880,"This study investigates the background, outlook and composition of the German-speaking community in Namibia and how it--and the connotations that the concept of Germanness itself carries in Namibia--were shaped by the arrival in 1990 of the ""GDR Kids."" These 428 black Namibian children were so named because they had spent much of their childhood in East Germany, i.e. the German_Democratic Republic. Many were orphans; some had seen the effects of war first-hand during the South_African attack on their refugee camp at Cassinga, Angola. The Marxist East_German SED government housed them in a renovated palace and educated them to return and fight for Namibia's independence under the armed liberation_movement SWAPO, the South_West_African People's Organisation. Apart from news articles, no literature about the GDR Kids' return existed at the time this study began. This study's interdisciplinary_approach included_participant_observation at the GDR Kids' weekly Jugendklub, interviews with Germans and Namibians responsible for the children, and analysis of the media_attention_they_received as well as writings by the GDR Kids themselves. These complemented texts on the history and attributes of German-speakers from the colonial_German_South_West_Africa period to the present. The GDR Kids' deracination and socialist education led both to their longing_to_return to East_Germany and their feeling alienated from the social_and_material_culture of their Oshiwambo-speaking extended families, which heightened intergenerational conflicts. As adolescents, they were old enough to have fully adopted German culture, yet young enough to evoke_sympathy less frequently granted to adults. Furthermore, their arrival_coincided with the shift of political_power from an apartheid occupying regime to multi-racial self-governance and calls for multiculturalism. The GDR Kids seemed more familiar to Namibia's ethnic_Germans and thus served to facilitate_the_integration of Namibia's German_language schools and other institutions including the media, which granted them more coverage than other elements of the Namibian diaspora. The GDR Kids blur traditional distinctions while simultaneously elucidating several facets of language- and race-based identity_in_Southern Africa and Central Europe."
48583,"The primary_purpose_of_this_study_was_to_identify_the_characteristics which promoted success of African_American_women in doctoral_programs in K-12 educational administration. A secondary_purpose was to understand the barriers candidates encountered as they pursued their doctorates and how they overcame them. This study_examined characteristics_of_successful_African_American_women_doctoral_students in K-12 educational administration programs. In addition, this study offered recommendations for increasing the success_rate of African_American_women_doctoral_students in K-12 educational administration programs. All African_American_women (86) in the five selected Southern Atlantic_Coastal states who graduated within the time_period of 1992-1997 with a doctoral_degree in K-12 educational administration were the subjects of this study. A survey was sent to African_American_women_doctoral_recipients to ascertain their perception as to the rate and ease at which they progressed through the doctoral program. Information regarding the factors to which they attributed their success, barriers they encountered, and the strategies that they used to overcome those barriers were also requested. The return_rate was 88.7%. Case studies were also developed using data_gathered_from_interviews with three selected participants and others significant to their success. African_American_women in K-12 doctoral_programs_in_educational_administration attributed their success primarily to faith in God, perseverance, and determination. The major barriers they identified were feelings of isolation, racism, and lack of mentorship. To overcome these barriers, they looked to other African_American_women and their professors. The perceptions_of_African_American_women_doctoral_recipients is a topic which warrants research. Within the undergraduate_programs at colleges and universities, an appropriate, proactive_approach to the recruitment_of_African_American_women who have the potential to earn doctorates appears to be a first step toward increasing the number of participants in the program. Involving school_districts in the recruitment_of_African_American_women who have earned Master's Degrees is a second step. However, since most doctoral_programs are housed at predominately white institutions, university_officials should be aware of the perceptions that African_American_women may have concerning doctoral_study at predominantly_white institutions. The overall theme apparent in this study was that African_American_women are faced with special_challenges and concerns based upon their race and gender. These are not concerns that should be ignored or minimized."
32639,"The purpose of the study_was_to_develop a culturally valid counselor_burnout inventory for Korean counselors. The Counselor Burnout_Inventory (CBI, Lee et al., in press) measures counselor's level of burnout through five dimensions (i.e. exhaustion, incompetence, negative work environment, devaluing client, and deterioration in personal life). The Korean Counselor Burnout_Inventory was developed by using the original CBI. First, linguistic_equivalence of the Korean CBI was examined by using the translation_and_back_translation method and by getting language feedback through a pilot study. To assess psychometric_properties of the Korean CBI, item-level analysis, reliability, construct validity, convergent, and concurrent_validity were examined. In addition, differences_and_similarities between the original CBI and the Korean CBI were investigated. Once developed, the Korean CBI will be able to provide_a_better_understanding of culturally_specific_characteristics of counselor_burnout and can aid burnout intervention_and_prevention_strategies for Korean counselors. The participants in the present_study were 217 Korean counselors who had at least one year of counseling_experience in Korea. Each participant completed the Korean CBI, the Korean MBI-HSS (Yoo & Park, 2002), and scales_measuring job_satisfaction (Lee, 2004), self-esteem (Kim, 1997), collective self-esteem (Kim, 1997), self-efficacy (Schwarzer, Iwawaki, Lee, & Yue, 1997), and a demographic sheet. The results of the study were promising. Item-level analysis of the Korean CBI demonstrated a similar pattern in comparison with the original CBI. While the Korean CBI has strong_support for reliability, construct validity, and concurrent_validity in the five-factor model (exhaustion, incompetence, negative work environment, devaluing client and deterioration in personal life), further investigation related to cultural_aspects would be needed for a better understanding of correlations among the five subscales which are, in some cases, not consistent with the original CBI. Overall, it is concluded that the Korean CBI, with some semantic cultural modifications, measures counselor_burnout consistent with the original CBI and demonstrates psychometric_properties for future use."
